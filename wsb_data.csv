Was someone naked shorting stocks for the big boys to try and impress them so he's finally let in on the big boy conversations?

**by now we have all seen the headlines, Melvin Capital supposedly closes Q1 with a 49% loss:**

Of course, whether that's true or not remains to be seen, but I have just spent half an hour inputting stock price changes into Melvin's portfolio, and **if it's true, IT'S REAL BAD.**

Apart from being **a fraudulent short seller**, Mr. Melvin is actually a pretty shrewd investor.

For the period ending 31 DEC, he reported to the SEC a **Portfolio Value of $22,639,690,000** across 77 positions, opening 5 new ones, and closing 36 positions. Mister Melvin sold a lot of profitable calls and stock at the start of this and previous quarter (at first glance), so it's also likely he is sitting on a sizeable cash reserve. But that's not the crux of this analysis. 

&#x200B;

**In this report for 31 DEC 2020, Mr. Melvin reports holding $19,787,325,000 LONG in the following stocks:**

Understanding The Market Requires You To Understand Market Psychology

Stock market intraday patterns – all times are in Eastern Standard Time!

When day trading the US stock market you may notice certain patterns, based on the time of day, that occur more often than not. These patterns, or tendencies, happen often enough for professional day traders to base their trading around them.



9:30am: The stock market opens, and there is an initial push in one direction. Highly volatile!


9:45am: The initial push often sees a significant reversal or pullback. This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself.



10:00am: If the trend that began at 9:30am is still happening, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback.



11:15am-11:30am: The market is heading into lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a few hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders will usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the markets tend to ‘drift’ for the next hour or more. 



11:45am-1:30pm: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it.



1:30pm-2:00pm: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in.



2:00pm-2:45pm: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, man traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stop losses closer to the current price.

\---

3:00pm-3:30pm: These are big “Shake-out” points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves.



As a day trader, its best to be nimble and not get tied into one position or direction. Many traders only trade the first hour and the last hour of every day, as these times are the most volatile.



3:30pm-4:00pm: The market closes at 4pm. After that, the liquidity dries up in nearly all stocks and ETFs, except for the very active ones. It’s common to close all positions a minute or more before the closing bell, unless you have orders placed to close your position on a closing auction or “cross”. 

Trade Entry Checklist - Things to Consider before entering a trade

1.    Portfolio fit – Make sure you diversify your portfolio. If you have 9 open bullish positions, consider a bearish stance elsewhere to balance your portfolio and reduce risk.

2.    Liquidity Check – If the stock you are considering has enough stocks traded per day. This can easily be found on Yahoo! Finance – look for “Average Volume.” Look for contract strikes that have at least 1,000 contracts of open interest – this minimizes bid/ask spread and ensures market liquidity so that you can actually enter/exit trades easily.

3.    IV Percentile  – Example: AAPL has IV of 45%, but IV percentile of 85%. This means that 85% of the time over the last year, volatility will be lower than it is right now as it’s current actual IV (45%). Likewise, if GOOG has an IV of 45% but an IV rank of 25%, then only 25% of the time over the last year IV was lower than it’s current value (45%). This means we have a 75% chance that IV will increase on average, meaning it’s current volatility is low – and we want to buy into that. If IV is between 70%-100% you will need to actively monitor that trade, higher risk.

4.    Options strategy - Pretty straight forward- If IV is high and the price of the underlying is also high, we can eliminate bullish strategies and focus on bearish, and vice versa.

5.    Strike Price – First you need to determine if you want an in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM). An ITM option has a greater sensitivity – delta – to the price of the underlying stock. So if the stock price increases by a given amount, the ITM call would gain more than an ATM or OTM call. This also means it would decline more than others if the price falls. ITM calls are more expensive as well – higher intrinsic value.



Next consideration is risk/reward. An ITM option carrier less risk, but costs more. If you only want to stake a small amount of capital in a trade, an OTM position may be your best choice. OTM positions are riskier, cheaper, and potentially much more profitable if the stock surges past your strike price.

6.    Expiration – Date similarly to strike price, the further out a contracts expiration is, the higher the premium because time is on your side. There is a higher chance of the stock  meeting your OTM target price given a year to do so, compared to a week. This is called Theta – a quantification of how much value is lost due to the passing of time. Theta also grows exponentially as you near the expiration date – your $190 strike call will be worth very little if the call expires tomorrow and the stock is at $180 because the probability of the stock reaching $190 is low.

7.    Position size – This is important – BIG TRADING POSITIONS WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BLOWING UP YOUR ACCOUNT. We suggest you place trades utilizing only 1-5% of your total account value, with an emphasis on the lower end. Play it safe, round down. It’s much easier to recover from a -5% loss than -80%.

8.    Future moves – Think beyond what’s going on with a stock than just in the current day – unless youre scalping. Is there an earnings report coming up? Can I roll this into the next month if I need to? Is there an upcoming dividend payout? Take the time to plan your positions and don’t rush your entry – You want to ensure the best possibility of success. I’d take $500 profit with a 90% success rate over $750 profit with a 50% success rate any day. You want to build consistency, and plan your positions before you take them.

8,"Maplelane is probably lying. Like Melvin, they (probably) still haven’t closed their shorts against Gamestop",1398,mnzcrz,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mnzcrz/maplelane_is_probably_lying_like_melvin_they/,236,"So the story is “[Hedge Fund Maplelane Is Clawing Way Back From GameStop Losses”](https://news.yahoo.com/hedge-fund-maplelane-clawing-way-165936610.html).

So they closed their positions hey? Gee now why does that sound familiar?

Remember the paid advertisments, the news stories and talking heads all telling us solemly that Melvin had closed their positions? They swore under oath in Congress that they had no more exposure, remember that? [At -49% Pepperidge Farm remembers](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/gamestop-investor-melvin-capital-lost-49-on-its-investments-in-first-quarter-source)

Unless somebody shows evidence to the contrary, I’m sure as hell that theyre lying and Maplelane is still shorting Gamestop along with Melvin, and the rest (Melvin, Citadel, Point 72, Maplelane, and possibly Archegos)

As for their “recovery”, well if I have $100 and I lose $45 a recovery of 6.5% on that remaining $55 is still only $3.57, bringing me back to $58.57. From the starting $100, I would still be down 40%. Thats not a recovery. Its bullshit, and its likely still tied to the declining price movement being forced on Gamestop lately.

This DD compares several different time frames of GME's past price and volume to now to show similarities, where we currently are in relation to historical prices, and where we could go. This is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor.

EDIT: before you read this, this is NOT a prediction, this is just a comparison of the past to now to show where we COULD be going. Stock price action often repeats itself but this is not a guarantee or prediction by any means.

**The big view**

This chart gives you an overview of the time frames I will be comparing. I will first be comparing the red and green squares to show that they are extremely similar in price action and volume. After that, I will be analyzing the blue square to demonstrate where we could be going in the next days/weeks based on the fact that the red and green squares share extremely similar price and volume action:

**Color-coded explanation for the above two charts:**

https://preview.redd.it/3hc8za4p3ds61.png?width=1478&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ed2a48f4ac2b7514bcc166dadfac4178109dc2d

As you can see, the similarities are uncanny. The volume patterns are identical, the two peaks follow the same pattern, the first peak is lower than the second but has higher volume, the second peak is immediately followed by a rapid drop in price, and the reaction to earnings and eventual recovery are extremely similar.

**Where we could be going**

The below chart is the blue square in the large-view chart. This represents where we could be going in the coming days/weeks based on the fact that the red and green squares that I compared are extremely similar. It follows that because the red and green squares are so similar and this blue square follows the red square, we could see similar price action to this square in the future. This indicates that we still have a few more days/weeks to go before the actual squeeze but that we should see a substantial increase in price very soon. Is this a guarantee? Not at all! This is simply using past data to make a prediction about the future. We very well could see the squeeze sooner or later than what this predicts!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j1l3h0hd4ds61.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=a88a66388e592b46edf741512b6dec1a3e6fc69c

There you have it! According to historical similarities in GME's price movements, we are in for a substantial increase in price in the coming days, we will then see a consolidation period, we will then see a monstrous jump followed by a slight consolidation, then the squeeze will take us to tendie town. The differences in these squares are that (obviously) the current price is about 10x higher than the previous price, however, they still follow a similar pattern. Though the price action is similar, this current pattern (green) seems to be moving quicker than the past pattern (red). If, in the coming days/weeks, GME's price and volume are similar to the blue square, that indicates that we should be on deck for the MOASS and, because the current price is substantially higher than the past price, this squeeze will be SIGNIFICANTLY larger in price. Again, do not take this as a fact, this simply uses historical price and volume to give a picture of where we COULD be going.

**TL;DR**

The current GME volume and price action follows pre-January trends extremely similarly. Using the past to predict the future, we should see a substantial jump soon followed by consolidation, followed by a monstrous jump, followed by consolidation, and then the tendie squeeze. Again, this is not a guarantee, this is a potential scenario based on past similarities to know.",1618097265.0

The response I received was amazing and lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes! 

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**                     

https://preview.redd.it/1dwe1p42xcs61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=a120cb970f727a95b925dca045324d6d551ba473

GameStop continues to be the top discussed stock though there has been a significant drop in the overall number of mentions (last week GME was mentioned 27K times). Tesla is now the number 2 most discussed stock. Facebook is the newcomer into the top 10 list but not in a good way. They had one of the largest data leaks (533 Million customers data was compromised) and the users were understandably pissed. The average sentiment across the comments reflects that. ASO also made it into the top 10 due to chatter on the stellar earnings report as well as the high short interest on the company.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/0l6jei65xcs61.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=3008545684de903944b2b4840d2c7e428e1442d9

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. 

**Romeo Power ($RMO)** was the company with the most growth in mentions. The stock was trending due to a 60% jump in stock price on Tuesday following a strategic deal they announced with truck giant PACCAR. 

**Nano-X Imaging($NNOX)** is a medical imaging technology company. They recently received 510(k) clearance from the FDA. NNOX’s CEO has said that the company is on track to commence system shipment’s from Q4'21. The company’s stock price shot up 20% only to lose over the next week.

**Academy Sports($ASO)** has been on the top growing stocks for two weeks now (which in turn made the stock figure in the top 10 most discussed stocks list). The company was mentioned heavily due to its stellar earnings report (EPS was an impressive 41% ahead of analyst estimates). Adding to this, the company is heavily shorted (\~40% short interest) and the stock price is expected to be highly volatile.

**Facebook($FB)** as discussed above was trending due to their data leak which exposed the user data of more than half-billion users. 

**Norwegian Cruise line($NCLH)** was generating discussions as its CEO has sent a proposal to the CDC on how the company could safely travel once again in July. The company is also planning to resume cruise operations for voyages boarding outside of the United States with sailings originating in Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and Greece starting in July 2021.

**SOME FAQ’s:** 

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.

37,PSFE: An undervalued play with relatively low risk and high upside potential,20,mo96ty,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mo96ty/psfe_an_undervalued_play_with_relatively_low_risk/,8,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h0hmwro2tds61.jpg?width=980&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5a271834a7f7e708b95da87853cb3d9f3bec52b

I am currently holding 384 shares of Paysafe at a cost basis of around $14.25 and plan to add more to my position under the $14 price point. I generally look for plays that have relatively low downside risk while also offering high potential returns. My current plan is to hold the majority of my PSFE shares for at least 2-3 years while the company expands and also to purchase a bit of commons to sell off after the first upswing.

Paysafe's company started in 1996. It offers several payment platforms including Skrill and Neteller which operate in many parts of Europe and is now growing in the US with the rise of online gambling. Much of it's revenue comes from processing fees that customers pay to make transactions with companies like DraftKings, eToro, Coinbase, RentMoola, Twitch, etc.

Paysafe has grown their revenue to 1.5 billion in 2021 with .4 billon of that growth occurring within the past 4 years. As online gambling becomes more widespread in the US and possibly soon in Canada, these revenues could increase substantially. They have a great team of entrepreneurs and seasoned executives from Paypal, Facebook, and Barclays. The team is led by Bill Foley who took the firm public this year via a SPAC and has plans to grow the company over the next several years. He is admired by Wall Street for his successful track record in helping companies to succeed.

PSFE is one of the few SPACS that have held up past the merger and this has happened even in light of the recent overall decline in sentiment in SPACS as a whole. Since the first announcement, it has maintained a steady average of around $14-15 with a low of around $13.50 and a high of around $19.50. There is a very low short volume on PSFE, which at best is bullish and at worst is neutral for this company.

Some possible risks include competing payment solutions and the insider lock up period which may drop later this fall.  In spite of that Paysafe has a great leadership team, a steady revenue stream, and is poised to grow. I could easily see it hitting $22-24 in the short term and $45 by some time next year. IMHO, this is not one to YOLO some calls on. It will require some patience, at least until the first earnings date hits and this stock starts to get some more direction.

39,MVIS Technical Analysis- Microvision has broken out and is on the verge of another spike,173,mnyo31,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mnyo31/mvis_technical_analysis_microvision_has_broken/,48," So, you FOMO'd into $MVIS, only to watch it go down all week.

Or maybe you were smart enough to realize you missed the bus, but still felt that twinge of *""what if??""*

Well, fear not, fellow retards, because I have broken out the crayons, read the tea leaves, and *allegedly* slaughtered a goat, spun it around in circles, and interpreted the blood splatter to predict the future, and I'm here to tell you that $MVIS is going to surge again, as early as next week!

u/WrathofKhaan did a great breakdown detailing the huge bull case [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/minugt/microvision_investment_thesis_and_summary_of_dd/), so I'm not going to get into that, but I will provide some TA to show you why it may be starting as soon as Monday.

Please note: I am retarded, this is my first time posting something like this, I am still learning, and I welcome any feedback or tips. Also, this is not financial advice, etc., etc.

To start, lets look at the 10-day chart to establish previous resistance, current support, and the stock's current pattern. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/trq7o5mi3as61.png?width=2676&format=png&auto=webp&s=75fbfd88582588b3bf5277c5fe719144c1e57986

If you pay attention to the pretty purple crayons (my most favorite flavor,) you will see that there was a clear resistance line at $13.75 from 3/25 to 3/31.  You will also see that after the spike on 3/31, the same $13.75 line has turned into a support line, establishing the base of the descending triangle the stock has been in for the past week.

Following the peaks since the 3/31 spike gives us the other leg we need to fully establish this pattern.

*“But wait!”* you might be saying. *“Descending bad! Stonks go up!”* 

Easy now, Chongo. Lets just zoom in a little to the 5-day chart so we can see what has been going on this week a little more clearly. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9smi88i54as61.png?width=2671&format=png&auto=webp&s=01f12003d28fcd831826b05c5b5d8ca03a7e5c4c

If you follow the pretty purple again, the first thing you will notice is that there was a **Bullish Breakout** in the last 30 minutes of trading this week. The decreasing volume throughout the pattern, combined with the spike at the breakout helps to confirm this. 

The next bits of confirmation we should look at are the MACD and RSI. If you don't know what these are, the important thing to note about MACD is that the crossover between the red and green lines generally means a change in price trend. Essentially, if red is above green, price is going up- if green is above red, price is going down- and lastly, the points where the two lines meet signify a current or impending trend change.

The important thing to know about RSI is that it is a number that oscillates between 0-100- when it hits 30, a stock is generally considered “oversold” and is due for a correction (stonk goes up,) and when it hits 70, the stock is generally considered “overbought” and is (you guessed it) due for a correction (stonk goes down.) 

However, these indicators can be kind of spotty at the scale we're at (15 minutes), so lets zoom back out to the 10-day chart, and switch over to the hourly scale. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kar7pail4as61.png?width=2683&format=png&auto=webp&s=71c3dd1f4c417f5e034b76bb4a87ea7c4bfdf780

Follow the tasty arrows, and you can now clearly see the history of MACD crossovers and price trend changes, along with where the MACD is now. 

This also gives us a better picture of RSI, showing that it is in an uptrend, but with plenty of room to go before approaching oversold territory. 

These indicators, along with the volume spike at market close, confirm the bullish breakout of the descending triangle pattern, and all of them combined point towards serious upward price movement in the immediate future.   

I'll see you retards on the moon.

48,MAXR DD,8,mo9re4,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mo9re4/maxr_dd/,2,"Overview

MAXR or Maxar technologies is a space technology solutions firm. They specialize in satellite imagery, and provide services to NASA and the department of defense including robotics, earth imagery, and geospatial analytics and insight. This company has a long history working with NASA, in 1965 it was known as 'philco-ford', and designed and developed the Houston space center for the gemini and apollo missions. Since helping humans reach the moon for the first time, the firm has gone through a number of acquisitions, and acquired multiple other companies itself. Today MAXR has 4 satellites orbiting earth, which they use for their primary business which is imagery. 60% of their business is satellite imagery services, and 40% is space infrastructure. 

What do they do with their satellites?

MAXR uses satellite imagery to assist the various branches of the military. The company uses satellite imagery to locate mission critical locations of enemy warships, airbases, communications systems, and other physical infrastructure that the military might need to form a tactical plan.  MAXR is a key partner in us army's project TITAN, USDI's MAVEN, and NAVY's project Overmatch. The most exciting (imo) technology MAXR offers involves using geospatial data to identify the locations of individual shooters on the battlefield. Pretty crazy, but the company can use satellites to capture images of the battlefield, and provide imagery to soldiers on the ground that pinpoint locations of enemy footsoldiers. The companies AI can even recommend actions to take against the located individuals. 

In the infrastructure business, MAXR has recently delivered NASA a space bus for mission psyche that will be travelling to a resource rich asteroid between mars and Jupiter. As well as developing robotic arms for nasa's OSAM-1 mission. Whose goal is to service and repair satellites in orbit. (as a vast majority of satellites are non operational). Satellite repair and reconstruction could be a hugely profitable enterprise, as it would save costs on launching.

&#x200B;

Bullish arguments

1. Fundamentals. Fundamentally speaking, MAXR technologies is a very attractively priced company. The firm has generated revenue of 1.7 billion in the trailing 12 months, with a gross profit margin of 730 million, or 42%. Compare that 730 in gm to the companies market cap of 2.76 billion and you realize the firm is very undervalued. 2.7billion$ market cap/730 million annual gm=3.69 market cap/profit. Which is quite low. (to put in context aapl=19, pltr=65, ktos=16, mcd=17, amzn=18, intc=6). This essentially means that if you bought the entire business, you'd make your money back on just the profits in under 4 years. 
2. Extremely difficult industry to enter, so threat of new competitors is very low. 
3. Much of the firms business is with multi year, government contracts. So business is locked down for a while. This could be a downside if the company loses a major contract however. 
4. Highly innovative company in a high growth sector. MAXR is the global leader in satellite imagery, No other company has nearly as many, or as important contracts with nasa and various defense agencies. Even Northrup-Grumman and Boeing aren't even close to MAXR when it comes to earth imagery services and advanced robotics engineering. 
5. Strong record of delivering net income available to common stock holders. (A lot of companies don't do this). 
6. Insider/institutional ownership. The firm is owned 66% by institutions, and recently awarded it's insiders 122,000 shares of stock options.
7. Technical analysis. The company is currently on a dip, after having found resistance around 41$ for months, before the stock offering.

Bearish arguments

1. Debt positions. The company has a large amount of debt. With over 2.5 billion of long term debt.
2. Recent dilution via stock offering. The company recently financed their debt by selling 400m of stock.
3. shrinking receivables. Accounts receivable are lower this year than any time in the past few years.

**BACKGROUND:**  I'm a scientist and I work at NYU and the CDC. Back in February 19 2020 before there was a single documented case of COVID in NYC my colleague (Dr. Mark Mulligan) hosted a seminar titled ""2019 Novel Coronavirus - A Pandemic Threat"" -- WHO was still hesitant to call COVID a PHEIC and the CDC was currently making recommendations against wearing masks. Mark shared that Moderna was a promising company and poised to deliver a vaccine for COVID sooner than anyone else and faster than anyone else had ever done in the history of the vaccine world. Mark went on to lead the clinical trials for Pfizer. A little over a year later and I'm fully vaccinated with Moderna.

On May 22, 2013 Tesla announced that it paid of its DoE loan 9 years early. It was roughly $19.42, it's now worth 34x as much. Moderna didn't get a DoE loan but they got grant funding and revenue well ahead of their financial plan. They're in a phenomenal position to do three things:

1. Increase production for their current operations
2. Fund additional research in flu vaccines and cancer
3. Pay back debt much earlier than initially projected just like Tesla did

A few times in a decade an innovation comes along that makes a great leap forward. Moderna is one of those leaps forward. In 2012 Alex Krizhevsky started the artificial intelligence boom known as deep learning as he advanced an old idea that NYU professor Yann LeCun pioneered in the 90s, the major difference was timing -- both GPUs and data matured in a way where neural networks could flourish. Less than one year later Rob Fergus at NYU reproduced this work, demonstrating one of the most important conditions for growth -- reproducibility. For the vast majority of biotech companies in clinical trials, you're rolling a dice and crossing your fingers. Moderna's approach works, just like neural networks worked -- they will reproduce and mature their technology and apply it to numerous serious diseases and will soon have an expansive portfolio beyond COVID vaccines. Moderna (MRNA) and BioNTech have shown the technology behind MRNA is reproducible and primed to flourish -- MRNA is on a similar trajectory as deep learning. MRNA isn't a new idea nor were neural networks or electric cars, timing is everything.

Moderna makes highly effective vaccines for COVID and Flu (soon) that can be developed in a fraction of the time. That's not even the most exciting thing about this company. Moderna and BioNTech may truly treat cancer and not in the way that clickbait articles promise -- but in the way that we used to see HIV as a life threatening disease and now we see it as a treatable and manageable condition. Moderna will benefit from its highly optimized and nimble operations, it's running at a pace that other companies will struggle to catch up with. While BioNTech has talented scientists they needed Pfizer to hold their hands, Moderna (MRNA) has proven far more self-sufficient in navigating the world of business. AZN, NVAX, J&J -> have proven to be poorer choices. They're slower to deliver, they overpromised and underdelivered (J&J), they're less efficacious and more dangerous (AZN). Meanwhile Moderna is scaling up operations to deliver more than projected.

**Near term catalysts:** 4/14: vaccine day, 4/28: annual shareholder meeting

**Long term catalysts:** Curing some types of cancer \~2023

**Longer term catalysts:** Making highly tailored personalized medicine to treat once life-threatening diseases \~2040

**TLDR: Moderna is a game changer** with room to grow. It's REAL value and not a meme roller coaster that ends right back where it started. Moderna is the next Tesla, hop on and **ride it to the moon.**",1618042359.0

Buy the dips, sell the Peaks, for 3 more years or just hold, you're going to fucking win. The only thing fucking this up is if Taiwan actually shoots down a Chinese plane and this old man has to intervein.  High Risk.

Now TSM along with Samsung have been setting up supply chains in Texas and Arizona. $TSM also is investing in japan. Intel is following with their Biden bucks to piggy back off the supply chains created by $TSM and Samsung. This will hurt intel and help $TSM and Samsung.

Conclusion:  
This investment will absolutely collapse with warfare between Taiwan and china. Especially with Taiwan's water drought. But if the US continues to BIG DICK for Taiwan we will see incredible growth.

72,Apple-backed Chinese ride service Didi Chuxing files privately for IPO with ~$100B valuation,3,moacyl,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/moacyl/applebacked_chinese_ride_service_didi_chuxing/,2,"* DiDi is a Chinese vehicle for hire company headquartered in Beijing with over 550 million users and tens of millions of drivers. The company provides app-based transportation services, including taxi hailing, private car hailing, social ride-sharing and bike sharing; on-demand delivery services; and automobile services, including sales, leasing, financing, maintenance, fleet operation, electric vehicle charging and co-development of vehicles with automakers.

*Owner and founder is Cheng Wei, ex Sales Manager of *BABA*, and Regional Manager of Alipay.

In 2014, Cheng hired Jean Liu (Liu Qing), a former *Goldman Sachs Asia* managing director, as the COO of the company.

In February 2015, the company merged with its rival Kuaidi Dache and was renamed Didi Kuaidi (later renamed Didi Chuxing or “DiDi”).

In August 2016, DiDi acquired all assets of the Chinese division of *Uber*.

Since the company was founded in 2012, under the leadership of Cheng Wei and Jean Liu, DiDi has grown to become one of the world’s highest valued tech start-ups.

By September 2015, Didi Kuaidi had obtained 80% market share in private car hailing services and 99% of the taxis market share. The same month, Didi Kuaidi announced the launch of a rebrand process, including a plan to rename itself ""Didi Chuxing"".

*2016: Acquisition of Uber China*

By the beginning of 2016, *Uber China*, which started its Chinese operations in 2015, had become a major competitor to Didi Kuaidi. Uber's then-CEO, Travis Kalanick, claimed the company was losing over US$1 billion annually in China.

In June 2016, DiDi closed a US$4.5 billion fundraising round, with investors including Apple Inc., China Life Insurance Co., and a financial affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. As part of the round, DiDi secured a $2.5 billion syndicated loan arranged by China Merchants Bank Co. This equity share fundraising round is one of the world's largest by any private company, surpassing the previous record set by DiDi.

On 1 August 2016, DiDi announced that it would acquire Uber China in an acquisition valuing Uber China at US$35 billion. [47][48][49] As part of the deal, Uber acquired 5.89% of the combined Chinese company with preferred equity interest which at the time equated to a 17.7% economic interest in DiDi. The transaction also provided DiDi with a minority equity interest in Uber.

In April 2019, *Uber* released a public version of its S-1 filing ahead of its planned initial public offering. As part of the filing, Uber revealed that at the time of filing, the company owned a 15.4% stake in DiDi. Uber's stake in the company was diluted (from 17.7% in 2016 to the 2019 stake) as a result of new investments from additional investors since 2016.

* 2017–present: business expansion, crisis and safety system enhancement

In March 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that *SoftBank Group Corporation* approached DiDi with an offer to invest $6 billion in the company to fund the ride-hailing firm's expansion in self-driving car technologies, with a significant portion of the money to come from SoftBank's then-planned $100 billion Vision Fund.

On 28 April 2017, DiDi announced it closed a new financing round of over US$5.5 billion to support its global expansion strategy and continued investments in AI-based technologies. The round valued the company at US$50 billion.

In December 2017, *Reuters* reported that DiDi had raised $4 billion for a global push into foreign markets and investments into technologies such as Artificial Intelligence.

In May 2018 the company received a wave of negative media coverage when a female passenger on the company's Hitch social carpooling service was murdered by her driver. In August of the same year, a second female passenger was raped and killed by her driver using the same Hitch service on the DiDi platform. Following these incidents, DiDi suspended its Hitch services in August 2018, and began to reform its platform with improved safety standards. In September 2018, Didi announced an investment of $20 million in customer service, The app's safety updates included an evolving set of safety precautions and in-app functions, including the formation of an in-app safety center, en-route audio recording, police assistance button and blocking function to restrict service from certain drivers and passengers. The company also invested $20 million in its customer service offerings and increased its in-house customer service team to 8,000 staff.[63] As part of the update, DiDi created an online discussion platform to facilitate online and offline national public opinion surveys in China. Media reported that in 2018, DiDi recorded losses of up to $1.61 billion owing to heavy spend on training and recruitment of qualified and skilled drivers.

In 2018, the company launched its ""Red Flag Steering Wheel"" program in which verified Communist Party of China members would be visible as drivers. The company also pledged to hire 1,000 Communist Party members as part of its safety drive.

In 2018, the company launched a bike and e-bike sharing platform and expanded vertically into auto service sector with the spinoff of Xiaoju Automobile Solutions, a platform providing auto sales, leasing, financing, car maintenance, refueling and recharging services to driver partners on the platform and independent vehicle owners.

* Since 2015, DiDi has invested in Grab, Lyft, Ola, Uber, 99, Bolt (Taxify) and Careem, and expanded into Latin America, Australia and Japan. In January 2018, DiDi acquired 99, a Brazilian ride hailing app.

* Services: 

DiDi serves 550 million users across over 400 cities with products including Taxi, Express, Premier, Luxe, Bus, Designated Driving, Enterprise Solutions, Bike Sharing, E-bike Sharing, Car Rental and sharing, and food delivery.

*Technology:

A few hundred scientists work on deep-learning technologies at the institute. To expand on this research, DiDi launched AI Labs in Beijing and in 2018 the company opened DiDi Labs in Mountain View, California. This facility mainly focuses on AI-based security and intelligent driving technologies.

Tl;Dr : 

I know for someone would be too long to read (trust me there is more) but took my time this morning to touch the “basis” of this company and share what I found.

This is DD for DiDi, I would encourage you to read and research on your own too, looks like we have a pretty nice gem here.

*Oh and Apple invested 1 billion dollar in 2016 and have a seat on the board.*
(Along with Apple’s $1 billion investment into Didi, the ride service giant’s major backers are SoftBank, Alibaba, and Tencent)

And connecting the dots looking back, with *Apple Car* plans possibly including a robo-taxi service, the company may have been able to learn a lot of valuable knowledge from its involvement with Didi over the last six years that it could leverage in a future ride service.

GOOOOOOD  Friday, Retards!  Well, week   after Good Friday.  Whatever.   NrdRage  here with your weekly dose of   ""what weird ass company I've  never  before considered should I throw   money at this time?""  Today  we're  going to be looking at a company with a  150 billion dollar  market cap  (I know, I know, I usually shy people   away from companies  this  big)...that you've probably never even heard   of.  I give to you,  the  techgrowthboomer (?  I dunno, I guess it's a new  space) utility   company:  NextEra.  I dunno, sounds like a fucking   sporting goods   store to me.

&#x200B;

# A   fucking UTILITY  company?  Really? First you talk about a garbage  engine   maker you  trash the whole time before going long, and now you  bring   this Boomer  ass weaksauce here?

&#x200B;

Yes,   yes I  totally am.  You're  right, they are just a utility company,  which   means slow and steady  revenue streams, by and large.  But they've  got a   secret.  Well, 3:   Their CEO could steal your wife without even   trying,  and they also  happen to be the largest producer of clean energy   on the  entire  continent.  Which means they get all that sweet, sweet    unregulated  energy income.  Which also means they're afforded the    benefit of  trading like a growth stock to a certain extent.  Which also     means...oh shit, let's wait on that 3rd secret for a minute.  Added     bonus:  Even though almost every green energy stock from chargers to     producers to makers on the market has been getting gangraped the last     few weeks (they doin' my boys $BE and $CLNE dirty, man, but they're     fighters.  Stop asking, I'm still super bullish on them both...)

If     you live in the Southeast, you probably do business with these dudes    in  one way or another.  Who cares?  If you live in Duke Energy    territory,  you probably saw them roll up into Durham recently and try    and buy those  dudes out.  Big fucking deal.  They've got their fingers    in power  delivery just about everywhere, though.  With the exception   of  some  mid-Atlantic states and some areas in the Rocky Mountains,   they  stretch  from Texas to fucking those weird fucks in Prince Edward    Island.  Cue  the fucking cat memes, because none of this is    interesting.

&#x200B;

# Let's see how this turbine runs:

&#x200B;

These    guys are HUGE.   Like, that  ""massager"" your wife keeps in her    nightstand huge.  Depending on the  day, they're somewhere between 47-49    in the S&P 500, by far the  largest utility on Wall Street.  They    generate between 4 and 5  billion a quarter in revenue, and run at about  a   25% net margin.   They trade at an absolutely INSANE multiple  relative   to their peers  (about 30 compared to an average of maybe half  that for   everybody  else), so they seem really expensive at first  glance.   They're   looking at about 9% YOY growth for the next 3 years,  which is    staggeringly good for utilities, but not mind blowing as a  growth play.      As mentioned above, they get away with that valuation  because  their   positioning as a global leader in renewable energy  production  moves them   away from utility and towards growth.  There's  not an  executive in the   sector that will tell you anyone else is run  better  as a company,   though.   They've recently been on the prowl to  acquire  somebody -   anybody - in order to expand their reach and market   dominance.  Hasn't   happened yet, but with the way their stock is   valued relative to their   competitors, it's only a matter of time   before they make an M&A or   two in all-stock deals.  Their   financial house is in order, and their   overall debt load is   respectable for their market.

The     great thing about $NEE is that, not only are they ahead of the curve    in  every way in transitioning from coal to other forms of energy, but    the  costs for these technologies continue to drop, meaning that  their    margins are going to improve dramatically going forward - which  is why    they can sustain the premium valuation.

So    no matter what happens re:  The  next paragraph you're about to read,    this (unlike the biotech stock I  talked about last week) is going to  be   just about the safest company  I've ever reviewed, even if my entire    thesis gets run over by a  monster truck.  It also doesn't hurt that  this   is the first stock  I've ever reviewed that ValueLine gives an A+   rating  to in terms of  safety.

# But let's get to the good stuff.  Shout-out to [/u/AllDatDalton](https://www.reddit.com/u/AllDatDalton/)     for bird dogging a lot of this information from his loft in a barn  he    rents from a kindly old man who's too tired to mince words.  Go  give   him  a like and a subscribe or whatever the fuck you kids beg for  all   day  these days.

&#x200B;

A  lot of you   idiots routinely  admit your shame in being bagholders hoping  that $ICLN   or $INRG will  do something other than fart when you poke  them with a   stick.  The  reason why these ETFs never do shit is because  the SPDJI   index only  has 30 stonks in it, and fucking $PLUG is the $AAPL  of the   clean  energy world according to it in terms of its weighting.   Which   means  if you bought in when $PLUG was rangebound from 65-70  earlier   this  year, you didn't make any tendies, and then you lost your  ass when    people got tired of $PLUG's bitch ass (Disclaimer:  I'm long  plug and    will be a bagholder until May when my calls expire worthless.     Fucking  $PLUG.  Don't buy that stock, and not just because they suck.  They're the anti-thesis of this entire ""Blackrock buying"" DD).

&#x200B;

Well,  that's   about to  change.  The number of stonks going into this is going  to   jump from 30  to....100.  At least.  Dalton (hmmm, I thought he'd be    bigger) has been  calling this the ""Blackrockageddon"", and you should    absolutely go read  his series of DD's on this topic.  I won't quote the    entire thing, but  the TL:DR is this:

&#x200B;

* On April 19th, this index gets rebalanced hardcore
* Whatever     gets added to the index, Blackrock (which, if you didn't know, is  the    Brad Wesley of the fucking investing world and the size of a mid   sized   country in terms of its assets) will be buying the ever-loving   shit out   of what's in there, because that's what they do.
* Therefore,     anything that gets added is going to get injected with a concoction   of   speed, cocaine, and some leftover Surge cola from 1998.
* This     index is going to be taking a sampling from best in breed and    influence  from a number of different sectors within the clean energy    metaverse.   Energy production, energy storage, smart grids, alternative    fuel for  vroom vrooms.  Think back now, children:  Who did I say was    the biggest  producer of renewable energy in North America?  Think   maybe  that company  might get added to a Dow tracked list?  Think   maybe, as  BY FAR the  biggest company in the entire fucking sector,   that company  might have a  disproportionately huge weighting in the   index?   If you  don't, you  might be the bad kind of retarded.  I'm   telling you this  because Dalton  has a philosophy to always ""be nice""   and he won't say  it.
* This is about as close to a sure thing as you can get.  95%, easy.

# 

# How much will Blackrock buy?

Dalton's     friend Wade says 400 million.  And he was wearing a manbun before it     was not cool, so you know you can trust him.  Actually, he had the   only   manbun in history that wasn't uncool.   My projections (this is   an   interesting thing, because he and I got interested in this shift at     about the same time) are slightly more aggressive, and I'm in the     480-520 range.  That's a lot of 1964 Buick Rivieras no matter who's     right.  These kinds of buys represent...oh jesus, almost 30 days of     volume for this company?  When you're talking this much money, you're     talking the back channels chosen retards like me use to buy our mass     quantities to consume (oddly, ThinkorSwim and JPM reserve just don't     have that much laying around), so you won't physically see it in the     order books, but you'll see an unexplainable melt-up.  Except that I     just explained it.  So there's that.

# Technical analysis, aka Man's search for faith, that sort of shit

I'm     going to do things a little differently this time because what I'm     DD'ing is really more of a momentum trade than a ""this company goin'  to    the moon, lads"" type of trade.   Instead I'm just going to show  one chart that explains   why the  hell these guys are so different from  every other utility out   there,  because I think that's all I need,  and then a quick 3 month daily.

&#x200B;

That    shit is fucking crazy.  I  mean, not ""ripping the throat out of his    enemies"" crazy, but pretty  fucking crazy.  In short, this gal's got    entirely too many brains to  have an ass like that.

One price chart, but no lines.  Just to show that it's winding up.

&#x200B;

# So, to summarize:

* Big     ass utility about to get added to the world's biggest clean energy   ETF  -  and, in fact, is likely to be the most heavily weighted stock in    that  index
* Has consistently outperformed everybody else in their sector for basically forever
* Is one of the rarer types of stock that isn't presently trading at or near it's ATH, so it's got some room to run organically
* Maybe you fucking $ICLN cucks who have been bagholding that shit ETF forever can finally break even now
* Even     if the momentum trade goes sideways, there's very low risk of   existing   tendies.  Your upside is significant, and your downside if   everything   goes as wrong as it possibly can is fairly minimal
* You     can still convince yourself as you cry in the shower about how old     you're getting that you're not REALLY old because you aren't buying a     utility company, but a Techility company, and everybody knows fusion  is    the best kind of food.
* Look     at it this way:  WHen you finally realize you ARE old and move to     Florida, owning shares of this is like getting a rebate on your     electricity bill
* I     didn't talk about it, but they recently had a 4:1 stock split, and     those usually provide some runway as people interpret the stock as     ""cheaper"".
* I     don't remember Patrick Swayze ever talking with funny accents except    in  To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar, so Dalton might    have  gone to drag.

# Price Targets:

&#x200B;

I'll     be straight:  Normally I would say it's priced pretty fairly right    now.   If not for the index shakeup, this would not have been my DD.    I've got  some short plays I'd like to talk about at some point because    the  market is going to turn to shit in May (and let me just apologize    for  not making a $DASH short DD a month ago, cause hoo-boy has that    been a  great play - hopefully some of y'all caught me talking about  it   in the  dailies).  I mean, more shit than it is right now.  As it    stands, I  think a short term target of 83 is really likely.  I've seen    long term  price targets of up to $113, but I just don't see it.  I    think $87 would  be where I'd start questioning you if you didn't take    profits.  And  remember, this entire thesis is based upon Blackrock    giving it a boost,  plus the added exposure that comes with being added    to a Dow index.  The  thesis all changes if that turns out to not    happen.

&#x200B;

# How to play it (There's always barber college if you fuck this up):

This     is a momentum play where you're just now starting to see the wind up    of  momentum (AKA ""How long you gonna be in town?  Not very long"").      Usually you'd see me advocate for some 90-120 day leaps 20% out of  the    money because usually what I talk about are mid caps with a lot  of    volatility that can flip your whole world upside down on not a lot  of    news because I like a bit of pod racing, but this trade should  resolve    itself much more quickly.  Buy some May 21 80c's ($1.50 at  the time of    this writing) and run like a thief if you want just a  little taste of    adrenaline.  If you want to play super safe, let the  underlying equity    come in a buck to the red and then buy $2 in the  money.  If you've  got   one of those working stiff retarrrrment  accounts, go into your  401k and   buy some shares.  If you want to be  ballsy about it all, grab  some   September 17 85c's for 2 bucks and  roll the dice.  The IV is  going to be   at a minimum because, even  though this thing trades at a  tech  multiple,  the IV is reminiscent of  the utility sector it lives  in.

**Commentary   that will age like milk:**    On the day of this writing, $NEE is slightly   green on yet another   no-volume largely red day where 10 stocks are   somehow making the SPY   green but most anything you'll track is red.    It'll probably fade into   red.  You might save a couple pennies.

# Position Disclaimers:

I'm     actually not going to tell you how many shares I have because it    sounds  like a ton (and, to be fair, it is) and I don't want to give off    the  impression that I'm YOLO'ing my life savings on this when the   fact  of  the matter is my managed portfolios basically is a mid sized   hedge  fund  and boring ass companies like this make up a pretty good   chunk of  that.  Fun money,  I've got 300 5/21 80c's, that I bought in   February on a hunch  about  re-balancing, and 500 6/18 75c's/ 500 6/18   77.5c (have been  building  that position since early March, so these   were OTM when I got  them).   These options, because they're so cheap,   really don't represent  a  significant holding even in my fun account   and my means of playing  this  trade is mostly via shares.

If     you're trying to shadow trade me, I don't know that the 6/18     75's/77.5's are the right choice because they're currently sitting at     about 4.60, but I only paid 1.47 for them so they made more sense for  me    than they will you.  That said, if you're risk averse, there's a    reason  why I chose June and I chose 75 when I started opening my    position.

All my love (And remember to not eat the big white mint in the urinal)

# PS:

Because     a lot of people have been asking me, as I've done DD's on a number  of    clean energy stonks:  While I think that $BE DESERVES a place in  an    index like this just because the type of clean energy they do is  so    damned unique and not represented by anybody else that is a likely  add    (nobody else getting added to this makes fucking microgrids), I   wouldn't   bet any money on it getting a spot in there.  I'll be   pleasantly   surprised if it does, but I'd put the odds of that at 20%.

HOWEVER,     since this index is tracking clean energy FUELS on top of clean   energy   generation, my boy $CLNE wants his shot at the title, and I   wouldn't  be  the least bit surprised if he gets a ticket to The Show.    Plus, I  mean  it's CALLED the Clean Energy ETF.  You can't spell Clean   Energy  ETF  without Clean Energy.

You successfully, very nearly, blew up the entire financial system. You forced a young boy from Bulgaria and a couple crooked unaccountable wall street institutions to pull the plug and flood the market with synthetic shares to save their yachts.

After the original short / gamma squeeze it should be stating the obvious that catching wall street in this position again is improbable, or at least not going to happen to that degree or with that vector. **We have entered into mid game and you need to adjust your thinking in kind.** We can still win and the hedge funds are still bleeding because of your diamond hands.

What we have below are the institutional holdings of a select few hedgies. They show massive massive, what I can strongly infer are long straddles with bearish bias.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bfc6l8ewt6s61.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a6befafbe5ebecd4794c08f7f71a29b12320ded

**What are they doing and why are they doing it?** After the initial short squeeze and illegal manipulation, the hedge funds had to make their money back or its time to put their kids into public school. They decided to use volatility plays in the options market as their way to take advantage of your exuberance.

When the market is moving like GME, disconnected from fundamentals, the ivy league suit bet is to bet on **volatility.** Melvin, Citadel, Susquehanna, Citigroup, and UBS (thanks europoors) are the biggest offenders in this story. When you bet on volatility, you don’t care if it goes up or down, you just want it to continue moving up or down a lot.

**Enter long straddles.** Long straddles involve buying the upside calls, and downside puts **together.** Normally, these are with the same strike and same expiration. Since you have to pay premium for both sides of this trade, the overarching goal here is for the market to move dramatically because half of you bet is a dead trade to start!  Losing half your money immediately is expensive! but thats just for starters..

To make matters worse for them… When you all are diamond hands'ing and even keep the buying pressure up, ie GME goes sideways, the hedgies straddles are losing on both ends of the trade…. And....  theta is decaying rapidly. Ie. The are losing time value of their positions.  They are burning through money in three ways! 1. Half the straddle is dead 2. It has to move dramatically for them to profit.  3.  Time value burn

TLDR; Im showing massive straddle positions from the hedgies below. These straddle options are bleeding suits when we keep GME moving sideways. Melvin in particular, doesn’t have straddles and they have massive puts, which again, are burning furiously if we keep this thing going sideways or up.

TLDR TLDR Diamond hands… We are still winning the longer we hold.

This is a summary look at a sample of data, we do not have complete information but we can make strong inferences to hedge funds positions and bets. The information is already out of date and could have changed dramatically. This is not financial advice. This is an opinion to think about.

I was looking through some of my old plays I had made in March, and I saw my calls that expired for $T on 3/5. So, I decided to check up on good ol’ boomer stock $T and saw that it had a decent week this week. So I take a look at the options for the week of 4/16 and notice the $31c has nearly a MASSIVE 100k open interest. That’s HUGE. And as of now, the premium is only $0.04. 

Now, yes I know this stock doesn’t move. Look at the 1Y chart. It’s a sideways trading stock. BUT if it pushes back to $31 that could make anyone holding some decent money.

[Shares of AT&T Inc. gained 0.2% in premarket trading Friday, after the media and telecommunications company disclosed that it will record a $2.8 billion pension-related gain in the first quarter.](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/62800911-b0c0-3303-a9fb-54776be21219/at-t-to-record-2-8-billion.html)

**Bear Case**

This stock lives to stay put at $30. Just take a look at the 1Y chart. 

Kong vs Godzilla was a mediocre movie lol

It’s a boomer dividend stock. 


**Conclusion**

This was mostly an interesting find I saw. I bought 100 contracts. I bought 50 when I saw, and another 50 before writing this. All $31c 4/16. These could expire worthless, or make a pretty penny. Let’s see. 

I’m not saying it’s a buy, I’m just pointing out this to people. 

TLDR: $T $31 4/16 has 100k OI on it, lots of people betting it’ll go up.",1618020432.0

This stock dropped 15% today but it is for one of the worlds greatest proprietary products with a well loved company.

The reason for the dip is because their earnings call had two negative points.

https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/08/wd-40-co-wdfc-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/

1.  Their supply chain is disrupted and they have already lost or delayed sales in the US market because of it.  The North America market was the only region they saw any losses in sales (1% ) while every other market had gains of 9%+ with the company showing 12% growth overall.   

This supply chain issue is global and impacting every manufacturing company.  It's a nonsense driver and WDFC just happens to be one of the first major manufacturing earnings reports to land since heavy supply chain issues have hit.  Google the term ""Force Majeure"" and you will find that everyone has been running out of raw material and shipping is backed up.   WDFC has better recovery plans than most (have a whole new supplier almost ready to launch in full and added shifts at some suppliers) and their market shares aren't at risk because no one in the market has capacity to steal it from them.

2. They missed projected earnings.  

Earnings were still great.  They have gone up and profits are solid.  This just falls back to supply chain issues.  There wasn't enough product to sell and their warehouses are near empty.

You need to buy this now.  Even the millennial obsession with quick return options is probably fine as long as you buy the stock at the end so you can get their sweet dividends! 🛢️🦅🛢️

I don't have time to put in extra quality data like my normal boomer DD release because it is already climbing again past it's 15% dip today.   Any time before it gets to 5% drop from yesterdays close is a good buy.  After that it might take a little longer to recover but this is a super strong stock.",1618019822.0

# The Canoo Paypig is back from the dead and she's about to pay out.

**The last time we spoke earnings had yet to happen.**

We theorized that Hyundai was doing crazy shit.  Canoo actually walked from the deal because they were charging hourly not for IP. That was a big mistake to not protect IP. Tony also announced cancelling guidance.  This is a big deal. Tony also announced they were going to manufacture their own vehicles which is good but no specific details. They also said they would announce a contract manufacturer to take the MPDV to market.  Reading the 10k specifically pages 38 - 39 there was material weakness from poor accounting controls. This is why the CFO got fired. Tony hired a bunch of people that have actual experience running an actual company. Tony said we are going to focus on fleet sales.  They might drop news about the contract manufacturer or about the pre-orders.

Market said get wrecked and my account went straight to zero. To be honest, Tony did the right thing for his company. In doing so and not just pumping the Hyundai deal where they were giving away their IP for pennies he also just lit my financial ambitions on fire and told me to get fucked. While I was crying into my pillow, we ran a sick ground game and found out that GOEV has a secret showroom in Fort worth where we snapped this [pic](https://i.redd.it/lqal7z93f8r61.jpg) of Canoo Chad Truk in the wild. My brother actually walked in there and talked to some of the people while they were having a party

**The biggest deal about that is its unreported in the media.  For all the shorts know Tony hasn't said or done shit.  Setting up a showroom close to the Texas Motor Speedway and close to an airport where executives can fly in for the day and check it out and fly out seems real fucking smart.**

# Here is where I want you Apes to start paying attention to numbers because this is real important.

[Monday March 29th - Day of Earnings](https://u.teknik.io/4ifj2.png)

**SP - H -12.54 L - 11.65 C - 11.8**

**SI is 19.7 Million Shares**

**Average  price of shares short is 15.5 (Avg $ SI**) - This will be approximate

It is important to understand where the shorts are in regards to an average price.  Until the shorts are underwater is highly unlikely that a squeeze will happen.

From now on we are going to round up and start with 20 as a baseline.

[Tuesday March 30th - Day After Earnings.](https://u.teknik.io/9F7MI.png)

**SP - H -9.78, L - 8.52 C -9.3**

**SI is 25 (+5 Million)**

**Avg $ SI - 9.4** [Here's the proof thank you @zackstrades.](https://u.teknik.io/9GmEb.jfif)

What's crazy here is that 11 and 10 were blown through premarket. 5 Million Shares short between these prices is insane.

[Wed April 7th - Yesterday](https://u.teknik.io/GfVht.png)

**SP - H 10.65 L 8.92 C - 9.53**

**SI is 39.8(+20m)**

**Average $ SI 9.2**

So for the past trading days we have seen an average of 6 million shares collected sub 9 and the rest collected between 9 and 10. Trading above 10 was very short lived and we probably collected .5 million total SI during that time period.

Total Previous to earnings SI average is 20 m at 15.5 (generous to shorts) Total Post earnings SI is 20m at 9.2 .  15.5+9.2 is 24.6/2 = Total SI for 40 Million shares is a cost average of **12.3. Below max pain. Lets get that straight.  Max pain for the 4/16 expiry is the same thing as where all the SI is underwater.**

Take a second to think about this.  Please check my math.

**The current cost to borrow is 51.3%**

**The second part of this perfect storm is the OI**.  There is a [gamma ramp](https://u.teknik.io/BcFuF.jfif)  (u/dekkars made a cool discord bot) and its slick as ice.

Today's chart is bullish as fuck.

This thing is going to blow.

Canoo has DFV. Read the [10k](https://investors.canoo.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001558370-21-003823/0001558370-21-003823.pdf). Get to know it. You'll fall in love with it too.

**So what could go wrong?**

Well you could come home from work early without texting your wife first.

Additionally, the larger shorts could absorb a lot of the momentum if its smaller accounts that blow.

Also

u/jn_ku gives some caution ""  so the question is going to be whether the people who bought at, say, $14.50 to $16.00 feel good enough to ride the rocket up past their buy-in, or they sell as soon as they hit their break even after being underwater for so long trade volume above that point drops off, so if price gets past $16 I can see it going to $25, which is a bit beyond the prior ATH if the volume is still going strong at that point for beyond $25 it would have to be a catastrophic margin call type event for the biggest shorts, who might actually be some of the market makers ""

I think that means ""Shorts are Fuk""....

I was going to mention this a few days ago but I wanted to wait until things were really past a point of no return.

There's no shares left to short.  20 million SI is underwater. Longs know what they are doing.

Bull Tzu is in control.

I missed you guys

I joined WSB a while back after seeing DFV's updates. I love to gamble, but have always played it safe with index funds - probably out of laziness more than anything. The GME vs hedge fund narrative got me excited and I knew I wanted to be a part of history.

So I bought 125 shares at around $60.

https://preview.redd.it/wstw0wf2s0s61.png?width=1454&format=png&auto=webp&s=6836e5261d16411b6801da9981c5b28b9a080b22

Fast forward a couple of months - I've learned how options work, laughed my ass off at a lot of memes, and received a little stimmy money from the good ole US-of-A that's been burning a hole in my pocket.

So I decided to YOLO that money + some extra into $GME calls and shares.

Here's what I bought and why:

* **4 20**0c  (4/23) -- DFV's 500 12c are expiring next week, which he will probably exercise (because he's a legend). Hopefully, he posts his YOLO update before 4/23 🚀
* 2 **420**c  (7/21)-- June 9th (**6/9**) Shareholder meeting could result in a stock recall or reverse stock split 🚀
* **6 9**00c (1/21/22) -- Since we can't predict exactly when GME will moon, we might as well bet on long calls and/or hold shares 🚀
* 10 more shares at 1**69.69** \- I like the stock and 69 🚀

TLDR: Used an unsophisticated combination of 420 and 69 to buy GME calls and shares based on limited DD and retarded ape logic.",1617947878.0

Based on the price of the S&P futures right now, the 1d RSI SPY just passes 70. It hasn't done that since late August before Spy fell $34 in 3 days.

The day before that crash the 9 day MA was $9 below and the 50d MA was $30 below. Right now, based on current futures, the 9 day MA is $8 below and the 50d MA is $21 below. The biggest separation since the Sept crash.

Our 30 day volume is 55 million, which is 4 million more than august before volume spiked to 149M before Spy dropped $14 in a single day. The comparison between later August and this month's volume and price action is nearly identical.

The reason why I'm comparing this specifically to the early Sept crash is because no news triggered that crash, indicators were just severally alarming and we had been in HEAVILY overbought territory for 7 days. Then a couple firms liquidated their heavily profited tech positions and caused the algos to trigger a crash. Tomorrow marks the first day of our heavily overbought territory. Since Tech caused the crash last time, let's look at QQQ

The MA before the Sept crash? 60 points off. Right now? 52 points off. RSI last time? 75. RSI now? 67. The Stochastic just flipped today, as it did last time 4 days before the crash. And while we're at it, small caps last time fell 1 month before the Sept crash and didn't recover, similarly to how they are still lagging considerably behind Spy and QQQ right now. Spy needs to hit it's support line (392) to keep the algos happy. And eventually, the algos always get what they want.

I know TA is just crayons on graph, and news and market sentiment is more important. But for short term option gambling, there's a lot of red flags indicating we are due for a pull back. I'm opening 25% of my portfolio in Spy puts tomorrow mid day (3 weeks out). And will do that every day as long as RSI stays above 70 and we don't increase volume.",1617961434.0

Palantir Double Click Demo Day is 4 trading days away. We all know what happened last demo day. We also know the morning of the friday before demo day we saw a 40 cent drop on open and then from $ 25.50 to $ 32. We've got more outstanding shares now true but it's popped from 23-27 pretty easily even without a demo day in the past month. So Im 100% sure all except my 4-9 calls will print. We are about to breakout of a Descending Triangle. When this happens we pop up to the top of the triangle. Except we are in at least 2 descending triangles. One from $ 30 and one from $ 45 I'd say if we can hold 25 that should do the trick. After that It's 27.50, and then $ 32- $ 36. Might even run a little higher. I don't know if we will break out tomorrow but I didn't want to miss out on 4-9 lotto calls just in case. Definite breakout next week though. Which if people were smart they'd be buying Right Now! Imagine selling 4 days away from a major catalyst at near 50% lows. 

Options have almost no premium and soooo many people have been selling covered calls every day. IT's time to take their shares. Don't sell covered calls before major catalysts.

If you take profit on your ITM calls in the next 3 Trading days, use a portion of those profits to buy even further OTM calls on dips. And keep repeating.

What we want to see is heavy increase volume. Volume has been too quiet. Way too quiet. The trading range has been super tight. 3. Cent moves. This is due to accumulation. And sellers have dried up. We've tested 22.76 support levels twice in two days and it has been rejected both times. So this is a key level to watch. 

 We also want to see the price hold about the 5EMA for a long period of time. Steadily climbing throughout the day.

I've got way to many option chains to post all of them. And I may not be done buying yet. It depends if we get a dip tomorrow. It might also be likely we drop to $21.86 before shooting back up as these are the rules of the decending triangles. The 22.76 support level will be key to watch. And on the upside 24.50-25.17 for a breakout.",1617953506.0

144,DD on Coupang and why it can it can moon,12,mnhnv1,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mnhnv1/dd_on_coupang_and_why_it_can_it_can_moon/,13,"As you may have known CPNG recently IPO'd with the valuation of about $35, leading many to believe that the stock price is currently overvalued. I've taken a quick look at this company along with $SE and I'm bullish on CPNG. What I expect is for this company to demonstrate to the market what theoretical saturation really looks like.

My reasons:

1. South Korea is a considerably large, dense, wealthy country with income equality. Wealth equality is overlooked when comparing Asia. e-commerce stores themselves thrive on middle-income participants. There is no comparison in Asia.

&#x200B;

2) Their lifestyles are extremely busy compared to the rest of the world and the tradeoff for money over convenience is likely going to create a flywheel effect. G-Market is considered the cheaper option to Coupang for now, but as volume increases, prices are likely to fall.

&#x200B;

3) Companies in S Korea, unlike SEA or China, are extremely ""Chaebol"". The large brick and mortar retailers have historically marked up their products. The standard was to sell something for multiple times MSRP Lately they have been getting destroyed by e-commerce and most of the e-commerce is being destroyed by Coupang. Ebay Korea has been looking to sell their position in the market for a fraction of the valuation of Coupang, but nobody is interested in buying. The number of competitors mean nothing.

&#x200B;

4) Coupang owns the entire supply chain, up and down. They own the inventory and they own the drivers and warehouses. Their algorithms are extremely good as well and it is catered to the Korea audience. As they gain control of this market and crush out the competition, Coupang will have significantly more pricing power. Their Amazon Price subscription is mere $2.5 USD a month.

&#x200B;

5) Receiving $4.6 billion dollars in cash is absolutely insane, given that we've been able to see how far they have been able to stretch the $3 billion from SoftBank.

&#x200B;

6) Coupang has demonstrate the deepest ability to monetize their consumers in the market. $SE has leaned on its extremely profitable gaming arm Garena to fuel infrastructure. But market depth and consumer service quality is unparalleled. Consumers trust Coupang enough to buy groceries on a daily basis.

&#x200B;

7) This company trades a significant discount to its peers for a few reasons, the lack of an AWS-like product. The reality is, Coupang is currently deploying the $4 billion dollars to tack on higher margin technology services. If you look at the second revenue line, the other sources of income is currently small, but growing rapidly.  The company looks poised to completely control a passive, wealthy and easily marked up audience upselling them on a wide range of products unheard of in other e-commerce platforms. Once that objective is completed, their services become exponentially more valuable.

&#x200B;

8) Currently sales are $11 billion dollars, looking to trend to $22 billion in sales for next year. Best Buy currently trades at $16 billion in sales and is roughly $30 billion, which is roughly about what Coupang trades in line at (\~ currently priced at $50 billion but adding on a much faster growth rate would place the company north of that line, $80 billion is rich but reasonable). The key thing is that adding additional product lines has been very easy. Kroger alone has about $60 billion in perishable food sales and Coupang is the only e-commerce company in the world to really have controlled this type of market. Companies with no foothold in grocery stores are likely never going to have that going forward. Purchases by parents are built on an immense level of trust and are not price sensitive. Chewy sells pet food (another super insensitive purchase category). There's a lot of $$$ to be made here.

&#x200B;

9) The owner is relatively good at pivoting and one hell of an operator so realistically you will not be able to buy the stock before the news comes out when they find their best new hot thing to drop $4.6 billion on. The best thing to do is wait for this stock to trade sideways for a while and pick up what you can while the narrative is focused on the inability to leave their home country (which ultimately will be the story for every e-commerce investment).

&#x200B;

10) Hostility to Coupang being unable to enter other spaces is overblown, other than general hatred for Chinese and the Japanese having hatred for specifically Koreans and humorous hatred for foreigers who don't take the time to learn a culture, there is no reason why Coupang can't compete in SEA. I've never seen this level of market domination in a competitive environment with reasonable profitability outside of Amazon. $SE has the advantage of Blue Skies and SEA gamer boys, but nobody can club heads like Coupang.

147,"Fubo Tv-DD: A potential Short Squeeze, but also a low risk/high reward investment.",278,mmzkjx,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmzkjx/fubo_tvdd_a_potential_short_squeeze_but_also_a/,97," 

Alright, listen up y’all. I’ve been working on some FUBO DD, and I will be presenting you a bull case, but not without presenting some counter arguments.

Pros: 

1. **Sports Betting**: As many of you may know, FUBO plans to add integrated sports gambling tied into their streams as an option. The sports gambling market is expected to roughly quadruple in the next 4 years overall. FUBO only needs to get a small slice of that pie. 
2. **Value compared it to its competitors**: FUBO has a market cap of about 2.9B. ROKU=48B. DFKN=24.5B. I think we all understand Roku and Draft Kings are much better at what they do then fubo, but 10x-20x more valuation? That’s a stretch. Simply based of FUBOs revenue and market cap, this stock should be tripled. 
3. **Aggressiveness as a company**; With the acquisition of Vigtory, and a recent closing of a deal with Marquee Network I like how they are not satisfied as a company and they are swinging for the fences. 
4. **Options spreads**: i don’t know if its big brained gamblers or insiders who know whats coming, but the recent Volume on Calls compared to Puts is ridiculous. A put/call ratio from 0.07-0.19 for the rest of April, and an implied volatility of 130%.
5. **Future Growth, Cord cutting**: Cord cutting has only just started. More and more will move to streaming platforms, and FUBO has been winning more than its fair share of those customers. Their expected revenue for 2021 is 460M which is incredible based on their market cap. They have 550k subscribers,73% growth year over year. Also their advertising deals are growing too, 53% growth year over year. receiving $20 per user for ads. 
6. **Institutional Holders:** Tutes own roughly 40% of the shares, Disney being one of the big share owners.
7. **Natural Cycle of a Growth Stock:** If anyone thinks this is a POS stock because it's gone down a bunch for no reason? Guess what, pretty much any young company has that experience before the rockets take off. Look at ROKU for example. From Nov19-March 20, it lost more than 50% of its value over that time period.Then it jumped up 600%
8. **Short Squeeze**: FUBO has some serious potential for a short squeeze, the short float is at 35%, and it's already been beaten down enough. We’ve seen plenty of examples of the shorts picking on a “cult” stock that is already down plenty from recent high, with relatively low float.

Reasons for the stock collapse:

It has been a perfect storm for Fubo bears. The stock has been  in a free fall since February.

1. A pullback from its parabolic rise in 3 months was inevitable.
2. The Q4 2020, ER report confirmed the company's growth. But because they are not making money, which of course they're not, there was a selloff nonetheless.
3. Money was shifted out of growth stocks to more profitable stocks recently.
4. There are some fugaze lawsuits coming FUBOs way, but any stock that has fallen this much is under lawsuit, this is nothing to worry about.
5. Arcehgo’s hedge Fund defaulted $30 billion, much of that was in media companies (most notably DISCA, VIAC, and to a lesser extent FUBO). 
6. FUBO’s IPO investor Lock-Up ended April 6th, and the sell off on the 7th.
7. The shorties, its always the fucking shorts

Cons:

1. Technical Analysis, which is wizardry to a mere mortal like me suggests that worst case scenario, FUBO goes down to $15. But I can’t imagine we will get there, I think it holds up at support. It has bounced off the 200ma 4 times in the last couple weeks.
2. I can only assume they are bleeding cash, and may need to have an offering soon
3. Their business model , vMVPD, seems like a very boomerish way of “cord cutting”. Because you’re still paying for a bunch of shit you may not want. 
4. Will the gambling aspect work? People like DFKG and fan duel just fine. 
5. There are probably some serious bag holders in the $30-40 range, and we could see some resistance from them as they look to sell when they break even. 

TLDR:

I think this is an amazing swing play for a squeeze, a good long term investment if the squeeze doesn’t come. FUBO is 1 PR away from triggering a beautiful run up, then the FOMO sets in, and boom, they are back at $30 before you know it. And if you degenerates start chipping in, we’re at $50+ in a heartbeat.There are some obvious negatives about the company & the stock, but if there wasn’t , this puppy would be at $150 by now. This is a low-risk, high reward play that we are lucky to even have the opportunity to be a part of.

161,State of the Market + ULTA Overnight Trading Strategy,12,mncezy,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mncezy/state_of_the_market_ulta_overnight_trading/,5,"  

**State of the Market**

Optimism is still high on practically everything in the market now. The main exception is the Japanese Yen, which is good for me, as I live in Japan while spending USD. Nevertheless, I do not think the downtrend in the Yen will last and will thus look for some way to hedge my dollar-to-yen (either by investing in FXY or leaving Japan).

Breadth is recovering, which is dampening our short-term pullback theory. However, a lot of the breadth recovery is in more defensive sectors, such as consumer staples. This could mean that investors are seeing growth stocks as overvalued and thus hedging against underperformance.

I’m still short-term bearish, expecting the gap in the SPY to fill.

**Today’s Trade**

I see a lot of insider selling in ULTA. We have director Charles Heilbronn selling half a million shares for nearly $2M and an overall total sell:buy ratio of 2.4, which is 50% higher than usual. When we see large amounts of insider selling, we are usually close to a top.

Unlike most stocks in the market today, ULTA shows an overnight dip pattern. Whereas most stocks are bid up overnight, ULTA sells off. This makes going short ULTA overnight every night a decent short trade strategy – and it doesn’t label you a pattern day trader.

With the current run-up in ULTA, it is slightly overbought. The Fibs also show that ULTA tends to pull back after such movements. With a resistance level at around $325, the current price is a good short entry point.

ULTA’s max pain for the end of the month is $305, so this is a good price target. That gives us about $15 profit downward. I’m going to be holding ULTA short overnight until the end of the month.

Three potential strategies should work here:

l Hold ULTA short

l But also sell ATM puts during the day

l Buy the puts back at the end of the day

l Repeat daily

OR

l Sell ULTA ATM calls at the end of the day

l Buy back at the open the next day

l Repeat daily

OR

l Buy ULTA puts at the end of the day

l Sell them at the open the next day

l Repeat daily

I’m going to run this until the end of the month. If you want a long put suggestion, I’d say go with the Apr16 $330 puts today and then switch to equally ITM puts a week out starting next week (i.e., the Apr23 puts).

Looking ahead into 2021, CEO Bill Toler, expects robust Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) industry demand will result in organic net sales growth well above the long-term company expectations outlined during their IPO roadshow.

**Controlled Envrionment Agriculture**

>Bill Toler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Hydrofarm, said, “Fiscal 2020 was an excellent year for Hydrofarm in many ways. First, our organic sales growth across the year was outstanding, increasing in each sequential quarter and culminating in over 60% year-over-year growth in each of our last two quarters as our entire company **worked feverishly throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to meet the growing demand in the CEA industry.**

*Controlled environment agriculture is a technology-based approach toward food production. The aim of CEA is to provide protection and maintain optimal growing conditions throughout the development of the crop. Production takes place within an enclosed growing structure such as a greenhouse or building.*

In other words, an advanced and intensive form of hydroponically-based agriculture where plants grow within a controlled environment to optimize horticultural practices.

The dual impacts of the coronavirus and climate change have had far reaching implications to our food system - from consumers, to retailers, across the supply chain and back to farmers and producers.

The urgency to innovate has never been more apparent. And with the right technologies, incentives and partnerships, our future food system can provide healthy food for all people and mitigate the effects of climate change.  

Controlled Environment Agriculture, including greenhouse and indoor production, is a small, but high-potential part of this future food system.

>The value propositions of CEA have been recognized by food and ag stakeholders, with local and urban controlled production receiving private investment to the tune of $2.0B across North America and Europe, emphasis in the [2018 Farm Bill](https://www.agriculture.senate.gov/2018-farm-bill), and interest from corporations across the supply chain.  

**CEA & Cannabis**

Cannabis growers grow some of the most expensive crops. Flower growers, at scale rely heavily on timing of the crop. Suppose if a flower grower misses on-time blooming for Mother’s Day or Valentine’s Day, that’s a huge loss!

Cannabis and most ornamental flowers are grown as annuals. The whole crop is harvested at once – e.g. cannabis flowers, poinsettias and petunias. Some other flower crops such as roses or gerberas may be harvested multiple times during the crop cycle. Another common aspect of cannabis and ornamental flowers is that they are typically grown as a single layer in greenhouses, hoop-houses and indoor farms. Indoor cannabis growers grow cannabis typically in two layers as well depending on how they maintain the crop habit. Flower growers also use hanging baskets (about a couple of feet below the truss) in greenhouses in addition to crops grown on the floor or tables, a type of a two-layer growing system. Cannabis and ornamental flowers are commonly grown on substrates. For irrigation and fertigation, cannabis growers typically use drip or hand watering; flower growers use automated fertigation using booms or hand watering.

Cannabis cultivation at scale is highly involved as it’s still a relatively understudied crop when it comes to growing more than a few plants. Growers use various techniques to grow different “strains” most of which are not fully genetically characterized. These are typically highly expensive operations. There is a common misconception that the plants will grow and yield linearly when added more and more light.

Every plant has their maximum photosynthetic capacity and could typically be damaged by high light even when other environmental conditions and rootzone factors are at optimum. During the initial stages of photosynthesis, plants harvest the energy of instantaneous light (imagine light as packets of energy) and store them in special molecules that later pass that energy to drive sugar synthesis (we call that carbon fixation). However, just like any biological system, the photosynthetic set up of plants could only take light up to a given threshold, and beyond that, light would be damaging to the system.

>Cannabis is typically grown as single plants on substrates with a lot of plant handling; that means there is a greater chance for plant to plant variation in growth, yield and biochemical consistency if they are not grown under **uniform environmental conditions.**

Cannabis agriculture is a multi-billion dollar industry in the United States that is changing rapidly with policy liberalization. At this time, more than 60% of the US population have access to cannabis as states continue to legalize.

The most significant growth in the cannabis business has been the emergence of CEA and its associated energy implications. CEA is a production approach that operates “sealed” (controlled) rooms to control temperature, humidity, CO2, and other conditions to maximize crop production, especially for high value crops.  While CEA is not a new production approach in the Ag sector as it has been used for other high-value crops it is **increasingly being adopted by cannabis growers as it can generate 3-4 cannabis crops (turns) per year, supports more strains and optimizes quality control far superior to outdoor systems.** The typical CEA operation for cannabis production can support one plant per 4 square feet with the potential output of one-half pound per plant. The CEA production model allows the grower to vary energy and water inputs by production phase, especially the variable lighting to address growth stages.

Properly applied, Controlled Environment Agriculture, from Hydrofarm will provide protection and maintain optimal growing conditions throughout the development and distribution of a cannabis or other specialty crop within the sector. CEA optimizes use of resources such as water, energy, space, capital, and labor, reducing expense and enhancing crop yields while minimizing environmental impacts. 

**Competition**

SCOTTS MIRACLE-GRO & HAWTHORNE GARDENING ($SMG)

Scotts Miracle-Gro CEO, Jim Hagedorn, calls the “pot business”, in which he intends to invest “like, half a billion” the “biggest thing I’ve ever seen in lawn and garden.” 

Formed in October 2014, Hawthorne Gardening is The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company's subsidiary for **cannabis growers** and one of the first major investments by a major United States corporation in the cannabis industry.

Did you know...

Scotts Miracle-Gro was the main financial supporter of push to legalize weed in New Jersey:

https://mjbizdaily.com/scotts-miracle-gro-leads-funding-to-legalize-adult-use-cannabis-in-new-jersey/

>The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company has emerged as the primary financial backer of New Jersey’s cannabis legalization effort, donating **$800,000** to two campaign committees formed to back the Nov. 3 ballot question that would amend the state constitution to allow cannabis to be bought and sold for recreational use.

GROWGENERATION ($GRWG)

The company owns and operates retail hydroponics and organic specialty gardening retail outlets. It is engaged in selling of products, such as organic nutrients and soils, advanced lighting technology, hydroponic, and aquaponic equipment, and other products needed to grow indoors and outdoors. The products include harvesting, soils and mediums, containers and trays, pest and disease control, nutrients and additives, hydroponics, grow lights, fans and ventilation, and cloning/propagation. 

**Technicals/Conclusion**

In my opinion, with [cannabis legalization](https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/7088824002) on the horizon and many Americans still in quarantine, people will turn to homegrowing & DIY hydroponic projects. This is why Hydrofarm presents a **unique opportunity** in regards to US legalization of cannabis.

Hydrofarm brings productive commercial technology to **home Hydroponics**..

Commercial growers have been using efficient hydroponic methods for years. There's no worry about soil-born diseases or pests, and there's no weeding. For professional growers, quicker harvests and higher yields are good reasons to use hydroponics.

>At Hydrofarm we’ve adapted these proven techniques to convenient home gardening systems. We have incorporated high performance technology with quality professional-grade materials, and designed a full range of systems for your personal use.

In fact, 2 weeks ago, Hydrofarm [Highlighted New Products for Sustainable Indoor Farming](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210325005955/en/Hydrofarm-Highlights-New-Products-for-Sustainable-Indoor-Farming) & CEO Bill Toler spoke about how indoor farming will impact the agriculture industry in a [recent interview with Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/indoor-farming-impact-agriculture-industry-150514534.html).

- *“Today we're certainly linked to the cannabis business. But really it's about a controlled environment agricultural sector. It's all indoor growing. And so we think of it as, we have momentum going in our core business, which is our everyday established states all around the country, and we have a legislative agenda that's accelerating the business.”*

- *”So we have good fundamental organic growth going on underneath. And then we have new states coming online, four states passed adult use back in November. As you mentioned, a couple more have added since then. And we feel like that sort of wave is going to continue as we go forward as really Americans say they want it legalized, governments need the tax revenue. It's all pointing towards continued growth in the sector and in the category.”*

- *”So we believe that controlled environment agriculture not only affects obviously cannabis today, but is going to affect you know vegetables and perhaps fruits and other things as we go forward. And we think that there are lots of money and innovation and technology going into that space right now, as you mentioned.”*

My thought process in purchasing AMC was that people will want to go back to theaters, there are plenty of AMC theaters all around the country, the impending summer blockbuster movie season and that COVID 19 vaccine rates are ramping up all over. 

I took profits at around the $18 mark in late January but held onto 3000 shares with hopes things will do better for the long term. Based on your analysis and thoughts how to you think AMC will fare in the coming weeks and months? Would it be advisable for me to hold or just sell since I will still be able to turn a good profit based on the current market price?

____________________________
So I'm sure everyone has seen the news on national ketchup shortage. In the past when news like this broke like the toilet paper situation. The toilet paper stocks rocketed. Sanitizer shortages, same thing. 

KHC was green today, but really not that great and low on volume. Any ideas on why the small price action? Just sensory overload, and it was overlooked? 

This stock is top 5 in Buffet's and Burry's portfolio. The company has made all the right moves in terms of paying down debt and making the momentum go the right direction as of late.

I'm thinking that being that we are sitting at a 52 week high there is a mental resistance line to cross. However if you remove that it really looks like this stock price is just ready to take off.

Some interesting catalyst I noticed there has been over $65 million in block purchases made. I'm not an expert on these but I couldn't see any other block purchases anywhere near this size on khc in recent past. (If I'm wrong on this, please show me where to find it.)

Assuming that Burry has exercised his call options or will rather than selling, Buffets giant position, the block purchases today, the consistent upwards momentum, the increase in demand and profitability on the ketchup packets. Things look really really good on this company. 

When first researching this stock I really didn't fully understand all of the fundamentals that have been falling in place over the last year to get us to this point. I looked at this stock as a great hedge if and when the market crashes as consumers rotate back into home cooked meals and groceries with less eating out to save money.

I see this article and it was the final piece of the puzzle for me. If we have another wave of covid,. KHC goes up. If everything opens up, KHC goes up. If stock market keeps ripping and roaring, KHC goes up. Market and economy crash, KHC goes way up. 

Extremely Bullish on this company.

I am certainly no expert but I love this brand right now.
If anyone wants to add to my thoughts or even poke holes in my statements I encourage it. Id like to know what everyone else thinks about this company.

**THE SITUATION**

Muddy waters published a NNOX short report in September 2020. It read **""NNOX has no real product to sell other than its stock""**. Essentially calling it a complete scam. They are fairly active on twitter, tweeting about NNOX, at times ramping up activity as they increase their short positions. Typical short seller tactics, calling every product fraudulent and accusing any insider selling stock as proof of a ponzi scheme.

NNOX April 1st closing price was $41.33. Single source **FDA clearance was announced Friday April 2nd** (markets closed due to Jesus). Monday April 5th NNOX opened at $64.00, after hitting $70+ in pre-market. Shares started dropping from this high right at the opening bell and closed at $48.55.

*Enter SSR*

**SHORT SALE RESTRICTION (SSR) RULE**

For those who don't know, when a security **drops 10% or more** (at anytime during the day) from the previous day closing price, SSR is triggered and the opening of new short positions in that security is limited. Under SSR, new short positions can only be opened as stock prices goes up, and this remains in effect until the end of the next day. Essentially **SSR makes it much harder/riskier to short sell successfully.** When a big short seller has enough control of a stock, they can **tactically keep the intraday drop to slightly under 10%, to avoid SSR while maximizing profits**.

On Tuesday, the NNOX low of the day was $43.71, a 9.97% drop from Monday close. That's an extra **0.03% drop away from SSR**. On Wednesday, the low was $40.40, a 9.74% drop from Tuesday close. That's an extra **0.26% drop away from SSR**. Sure we can't rule out this out as a coincidence, so we'll just call it **statistically extremely improbable.**

Despite a disagreement of their thesis from the FDA, muddy appears to be playing their usual games.

**SHORT VOLUME**

If any one of you autists has access to **updated** short interest %, please share. Meanwhile [short volume is here](https://imgur.com/Z79jHw1). Jump in short:volume ratio has sustained post fda approval announcement.

**TODAY**

This morning, there was more positive news for NNOX, involving a partner's (FujiFilm) **[patent filing](https://twitter.com/TerraPharma1/status/1380137316434341890) that would use Nanox rights and IP for innovative mammography equipment**. This news may have helped create a small pop in NNOX price this morning, but once again the shorts squashed any bounce and brought NNOX to even lower levels than yesterday. NNOX closed today at $40.08, a **lower price than it was before FDA clearance**, only three market days after the news. 

**PRICE ACTION**

For anyone familiar with price action when a big short seller is involved, the [NNOX 5 day chart](https://imgur.com/PiFaFfD) paints a pretty clear picture. A gradual slide each day, with any potential peak quickly snuffed out and brought back down to a new low.

**CONCLUSION**

Before Ellen_Degenerate_69 chimes in, you're right, selling on news is nothing new. However, context matters. The majority of the bear thesis hinged on a lack of regulatory clearance. **Recent price action, short volume, and narrow SSR avoidance is all consistent with a big player at the table**. Considering their outspokenness on this company, all signs point towards muddy waters & co.

**TLDR: Nanox (NNOX) has the potential to revolutionize medical imaging, recently reached a milestone with FDA clearance, shares have been dragged down by 🌈🐻’s, and is de-risked at current levels. I like the stock.**

184,Plug Power: Sell the Dip,77,mmxbiy,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/,77,"**tl;dr: PLUG has a history of burning shareholders and customers, does not make an economical product, and the shares are worth much closer to $0 than to $30. If you're thinking of buying shares or calls, don't. If you hold shares or calls, sell them. If you want to make a bet, buy puts.**

It's July 2000. You've made a decent amount of tendies over the past few years investing in hot tech companies. The markets are down a fair bit from their March highs, but that just means there are more buying opportunities. Maybe you can find the next Microsoft.

You find a stock that looks promising -- Plug Power. It's down 50% from its 52-week high, but you're sure it's gonna be huge. Green energy is the future. It's got the largest company in the world, General Electric, as an investor. [Bob Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli), the head of GE Power Systems and a contender to succeed Jack Welch, is on the board of directors. And their joint venture with GE just announced a deal to sell 1500 fuel cells to a Saudi Arabian trading company controlled by the royal family. If even the oil kingdom is moving to the hydrogen economy, you want to be a part of it. You're buying.

Over the next few years, you will lose more than 95% of your investment.

What happened? Well, there is public documentation on some of this: the Saudi trading company sued Plug and the GE subsidiary that co-owned the joint venture in 2008 for breach of contract and misrepresentation. You can find a summary of the complaint [here](https://casetext.com/case/soroof-trading-development-company-ltd-plaintiff-v-ge-microgen-inc-and-plug-power-inc-defendants), but I'm working from a copy of their First Amended Complaint.

The complaint alleges that GE and Plug ""understood by February 1999 that [Plug's fuel cells] would never be marketable"" but formed the joint venture (GE Fuel Cell Systems, which I'll call either GEFCS or just ""the JV"" for short) anyway to try and recoup costs. Soroof (the name of the Saudi trading company, but I'll call them ""the guys who financed 9/11"" for long) further alleges that GEFCS was just an empty shell with ""nominal assets consisting of a small amount of furniture, a telephone switch and a computer server"" and an office subleased from Plug. And GEFCS duly extracted $1 million from the guys who financed 9/11 in exchange for exclusive rights to distribute the fuel cells in Saudi Arabia.

Somewhat incredibly, the complaint alleges that Plug and GE then proceeded to jerk around the guys who financed 9/11 for *five years*, telling Soroof over and over again that they were improving the product and it wasn't quite ready yet but it would be soon. Finally, ""In 2005, Soroof expressed its dissatisfaction with [GE and Plug's] complete lack of performance to date"", which you might recognize as the same thing your wife did right before she introduced you to Chad. The JV had effectively been dead for years (or so Soroof claims), but GE and Plug knew to expect a lawsuit, and hurriedly wound up the operation, with PLUG indemnifying GE against the first $1 million in claims arising from GEFCS. Plug [filed an 8-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000119312506063079/d8k.htm) notifying the markets of the termination of the JV, but they didn't tell the Saudis. And when the Saudis found out in early 2007, they completely lost their shit, and they sure did sue. (As best as I can tell the lawsuit ended up dissolving in a flurry of procedural arguments. I'm not a lawyer and I don't care.)

So if this complaint was filed by the guys who financed 9/11, why should you believe them? Well, there are other signs that the higher-ups at GE knew pretty quickly that Plug's fuel cells weren't going to be commercially viable. GE had agreed to buy fuel cells from Plug in early 1999 -- but they [couldn't meet specifications](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB957739751789506989) and cancelled the entire contract in spring 2000. Bob Nardelli was [off the board by mid-July 2000](https://eepower.com/news/john-g-rice-assumes-position-on-plug-powers-board-of-directors/), and it's telling that neither his [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobnardelli/) nor [his successor's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-rice-30b651118/?originalSubdomain=hk) nor the [president of the JV](https://biography.omicsonline.org/france/technip/barry-glickman-36852) makes reference to their involvement with Plug or GEFCS. And this also sounds like the MO of General Electric circa 2000, which was, in hindsight, [a bag of shit trading at 50 times earnings](https://philo.substack.com/p/success-theater) propped up by expansion into questionable businesses like long-term care insurance and a whole bunch of accounting gimmicks. That stock is also down more than 80% from its October 2000 high, although at least you got paid a dividend for your trouble.

But the biggest reason GE should have known early that Plug's fuel cells wouldn't be marketable is basic physics. To get green hydrogen, you need to consume electricity to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen (losing some along the way). Then you need to consume more energy to compress and transport the hydrogen. Then you turn it back into water, electricity and waste heat in a fuel cell. It's much cheaper and more efficient to transmit the energy directly over high-voltage power lines! For some applications -- like the forklifts that Plug promotes today -- there is a last-mile problem to solve, but as I'm sure you've heard, battery technology today is very good, and it's just more economical to use battery power. (I'll have more to say about both the physics and the forklifts in follow-on posts.)

Through the fiscal years 2001-6, Plug Power produced a cumulative loss of $16 million on $67 million of revenue *before any operating expenses*. Their net loss was much worse. By early 2007, the stock was trading at about where it is today on a split-adjusted basis, and if you bought in July 2000 you were down 95%. It got cut by another 90% before it rallied last year. And today looks a lot like July of 2000: Plug is [partnering with big oil companies](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fossil-fuel-mainstay-baker-hughes-joins-plug-power-in-green-hydrogen-fund-11617629145) and [taking sovereign investment money](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921001786/tm211407d2_8k.htm). More worryingly, it's delinquent filing its 10-K for 2020 and is [restating its accounts](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-to-restate-financial-statements-stock-plunges-11615930211) for the last two years, and it posted a [negative gross profit in Q3 2020](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837020013381/plug-20200930x10q.htm). Learn from the mistakes of the past. Sell the dip in PLUG.

In the past when news like this broke like the toilet paper situation. The toilet paper stocks rocketed.   Sanitizer shortages, same thing.  

KHC was green today, but really not that great and low on volume.  Any ideas on why the small price action?
Just sensory overload, and it was overlooked?   


This stock is top 5 in Buffet's and Burry's portfolio. The company has made all the right moves in terms of paying down debt and making the momentum go the right direction as of late.

I'm thinking that being that we are sitting at a 52 week high there is a mental resistance line to cross. However if you remove that it really looks like this stock price is just ready to take off.

Some interesting catalyst I noticed there has been over $65 million in block purchases made.  I'm not an expert on these but I couldn't see any other block purchases anywhere near this size on khc in recent past.  (If I'm wrong on this, please show me where to find it.)

 Assuming that Burry has exercised his call options or will rather than selling, Buffets giant position, the block purchases today, the consistent upwards momentum, the increase in demand and profitability on the ketchup packets.      Things look really really good on this company.  


When first researching this stock I really didn't fully understand all of the fundamentals that have been falling in place over the last year to get us to this point.   I looked at this stock as a great hedge if and when the market crashes as consumers rotate back into home cooked meals and groceries with less eating out to save money.


I see this article and it was the final piece of the puzzle for me.   If we have another wave of covid,. KHC goes up. If everything opens up, KHC goes up.   If stock market keeps ripping and roaring, KHC goes up.   Market and economy crash, KHC goes way up.    

Extremely Bullish on this company.

I am certainly no expert but I love this brand right now.  
If anyone wants to add to my thoughts or even poke holes in my statements I encourage it.   Id like to know what everyone else thinks about this company.

Position update request: I have 600 call option contracts ranging between $40-$41 most of them expiring tomorrow and 16th and 23rd.   Less than 100 expire further out.      I have $45 strike prices as far out as October.    Additionally 300 shares

This is not a short squeeze play as some have asked.

However with the insanely high option call interest ITM or close there could be some significant GAMMA movement I would speculate.

I have been following shortable shares and the availability of them.     As the price has approached $41 there is usually a huge drop in available shares to short right after a steep drop.   This would indicate short ladder attacks by market makers to keep it under $41.   

Speculation and patterns suggest to me that breaking the $41 mark with momentum would generate enough of a mini short squeeze as well as Gamma to push it immediately to $42-$43 which is then breaking the 52 week high.  After that.  We should see it price closer to proper valuation and by the time earnings come out I think we will be genuinely surprised by what all they have been working on and making progress on their bottom line.",1617936599.0
191,Two Ways to Play Fannie Mae (and Freddie Mac),13,mn648p,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mn648p/two_ways_to_play_fannie_mae_and_freddie_mac/,23,"A month or so ago I wrote up some DD trying to give people accurate info on the GSEs (government sponsored entities).

That DD can be seen here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkvj3g/fannie_mae_and_freddie_mac_reality_check/

I am writing this up as we have started to see some price action in the assets under these two companies and thought people may appreciate some info.

First off - The two ways I see you can play this:

1. Buy either liquid preferred shares (FNMAS) or the underlying equity (FNMA or FMCC). Your goal is to have liquidity so you can exit your position anytime. You're gonna try do a timing play, buying now and selling before the SCOTUS announcement when the market has conceivably bid up the shares in anticipation. This is of course fraught with all the typical risk of trying to time something as well as believing that more demand is going to take place prior to the trial announcement. You could potentially make 10-30% though in a month based off of what I have seen pre trial announcements in the past.


2. You purchase preferred stock and ride this baby with me come hell or high water. Hell yeah. Preferred stock are the safer vehicle because A. Equity has no place at the negotiation table. B. A lot more good shit has to happen for equity to payoff than the good shit for the preferred. 5x from here on the preferred is good enough for me, that's for sure.

Or you can of course do nothing.

Ok, so what is this all about?

SCOTUS (supreme court of the USA) is about to make an announcement (~1-2 months) saying whether the US Treasury basically nationalized FNMA and FMCC during 2008-2012 and thus owe the shareholders a shit ton of money. However, while they can rule the NWS (net worth sweep) is void, my money is on them backing up the APA claim and sending it to the lower courts for judgement while nullifying MC (Mark Calabria's) job security at the FHFA (the conservator/regulator). 

This would still be very good for the price action, 2-3x from here                              would be awesome. The APA claim is strong and ACTUALLY on the evidence for once, which is extremely damning for the US gov if you read it, if it goes that way, we could still get an early settlement. Although the gov has basically been a nonstop bull dog in this fight, never relenting nor backing down, so it could still be years to actually finalize a resolution.

SCOTUS could also rule completely against plaintiffs. Womp womp, we probably lose about 60-75% from here, and our main last hope would go to a case happening in 2022.

Anyways, that's all, if you had bought during my last post you would have gained a nice 15-20% (edit, someone said they made closer to 30%, nice for them!) already. No idea what happens going forward though.",1617959083.0
192,"Top 7 Must Know Things Right Now (Stocks, Yields, The FED, $TSLA & More)",53,mmvxip,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmvxip/top_7_must_know_things_right_now_stocks_yields/,14,"**In today’s post I’m going to share with you what I believe to be the 7 most important things from the past couple of weeks that may impact the stock market, your portfolio & much more!**

**\[Disclaimer: Long Post\]**

Folks, we’ve seen a crazy start to 2021 in the stock market with massive gains through February, before most retail portfolios took a huge hit in March as high-flying tech stocks were hit by rising treasury yields & inflations scares from boohoo “suits” that pop up in your face on TV or on YouTube.

[This](https://imgur.com/HXfdXsl) is the 3-month chart of how stocks have performed, and guess what? Most stocks are actually gaining significantly this year with the exception of Apple, Amazon & a couple of other stocks.

I believe there is a lot of panic especially from financial YouTubers just because they have seen their portfolios drop in value in the last weeks, but guess what, most of those portfolios are way too heavy in the small-cap growth stocks or stocks that are trading at very high PE’s. From my point of view, I expect the stock market to continue to go higher this year, lead especially by big companies with great earnings that are not trading at insane PE’s and which have underperformed in the past months, think of names like Apple, Amazon & others.

Small-caps & value stocks have really jumped in the past months, and are due for some underperformance in my opinion, with value stocks reaching very high PE’s as well due to the recent “booming economy” helped by the massive stimulus packages the US has used to fight the potential economic meltdown from last year.

Just take a look at this [chart](https://imgur.com/ADGuTKt) & you can see that small & mid-caps stocks especially in the value sectors have really outperformed. Take the 400 mid & small cap sp500 ETFs, those rose by 14% & 20% which is insane for a 3-month period, while the Nasdaq only gained 3.4% for the hole quarter, underperforming both the Dow & SP500.

Guys, let’s jump to the 7 most important things you should now that may affect your portfolio:

**1.** **Inflation & Yields. So, will the global surge in liquidity cause inflation?**

My short answer is **NO**. I don’t think the massive stimulus packages & other fiscal aids around the world will cause inflation, especially in the old developed economies like Europe & the US.

Though you can see the total money [supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MABMM301USM189S) for the US has spiked in the last year, this was needed to keep the US away from a potential depression. The US printed around $3.9B until January and this will continue to increase with the added stimulus package & proposed infrastructure bill.

Most of the recent panic in the stock market that was caused by this money printing potentially brining inflation, and those scares might continue to pop up from time to time in the next couple of months, especially as the year/year inflation readings come in which might spoke some investors, though the FED & mostly everyone is already expecting this. 

On the other hand, if by any miracle, we don’t see a huge spike in the year/year inflation numbers, in my opinion, we are poised to see a correction in treasury [yields](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y), maybe towards the 1.5% level again, which can lead to tech stocks & especially small-cap ones to resume their path higher.

[Inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA) hasn’t be a problem really in many many years, so a 2% targeted inflation by the FED is pretty healthy for the US economy & given the fact that most participants for a recent [survey](https://imgur.com/uIaNKBr) think 2% yields can cause a correction in the stock market, a lower than expected inflation number can help mitigate that risk.

It’s also very interesting to see that the inflation is the 2nd biggest [concern](https://imgur.com/yIgQVYn) though our next important subject the possibility of rising interest rates is very close behind.

**2. FED Rates.** 

So, everyone is talking about the FED and if or when are they going to raise the key interest [rate](https://imgur.com/UFr9tiC) and stop the huge asset purchase spree they have been on since last year.

Right [now](https://imgur.com/HqtPCKs), that rate hovers near 0 while the FED is also buying $120B in assets every single month which is an insane amount, as they are literally buying a GE, Goldman Sachs, AirBNB or any other huge company you can think of every single month.

The [DOT-PLOT](https://imgur.com/s0avQp0) of the FED has become the buzziest thing in recent months, and though last month we saw more officials expecting a rate increase next year, compared to the single one we saw in December, that is still a minority.

The dot-plot is pretty interesting from my point of view. Even if there are a couple more officials who expect a rate hike, the level of that hike is so low (meaning under 1% for 2022 and around 1% for 2023)… just compare that to the long-run target of 2.5%, just imagine how much better things must get in the economy for the FED to hike the rates so much.

It’s also very important to point out the FED is very likely to wait to see a sustained inflation over 2% before actually tightening policy, as this is the new framework they are pushing, a fact which was stated by the vice chair of the FED in a recent [interview](https://imgur.com/V4YJqOh).

We can see in the latest [projections](https://imgur.com/Zr1ffpy) by the FED the biggest change was in the GDP growth expectations for 2021, while in the long run they are still only expecting a 1.8% GDP growth.

This will be an interesting aspect to watch this year as everyone seems to be bumping up their GDP expectations, with [Goldman](https://imgur.com/m0w0PXo) expecting a 7% growth for 2021.

**3.** **Deceiving unemployment numbers.**

We have seen [jobless](https://imgur.com/jn0tZpB) [claims](https://imgur.com/70bI1tP) getting [better](https://imgur.com/x6azae0) in the past couple of weeks, with continuing jobless claims dropping below 4M, though the initial claims saw a significant spike to over 700K once again last week. 

Nonfarm payrolls also [smashed](https://imgur.com/7jsI57U) expectations rising by over 900k, topping estimates of around 650k, with the jobless rate dropping to 6%. 

It’s still important though to remember that we are still 8M jobs down [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS) to February of last year, and though this started as a V shaped recovery in the job market the recovery rate has slowed down and it will take quite some time for the US to go back up to those numbers.

The 6% unemployment [rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) is still deceiving as that only accounts for people actively looking for a job, and leaves out the rest of the people, so the U6 unemployment rate is a much better way to look at the whole picture.

[U6 unemployment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE) leaves us with a rate of over 10% which is still more than 3.5% away from the numbers we had before 2020.

It’s still interesting to see that only 30% of the jobs [created](https://imgur.com/wBg6aQc) last month were from the hardest hit sector, leisure & hospitality. We must keep an eye on this sector, as it might be key for the recovery in unemployment, still being down millions of jobs [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USLAH) to previous years.

**4. Suez Canal blockage** 

[This](https://imgur.com/7L5Y79P) created an even bigger [stress](https://imgur.com/PO7FiEc) on some parts of the economy. Fortunately the blockage lasted just around 1 week, and though that brought a spike in oil prices, you should be very careful when investing into commodities, especially oil, as we have just seen [OPEC](https://imgur.com/6ag8bu1) planning on brining back online more production, which is likely to continue as they see an increasing demand, so it’s very hard to see oil prices rising much more than this, as any time prices go up, they will be dragged down by an increasing supply from OPEC. Just stay away, as demand might even disappoint in the short-term, as the grand reopening might hit road bumps along the way, putting even more pressure on OIL prices.

**5.** **EVs**

In the past couple of weeks, we have seen EV maker after EV marker smashing delivery expectations.

[NIO](https://imgur.com/g4vJxSK) delivered over 20k in Q1, [Ford](https://imgur.com/61piwPA) grew EV sales by more than 70% and [Tesla](https://imgur.com/WqUqhV6) beat expectations and topped 180K cars delivered in a seasonally bad Q1, which is pretty impressive.

Though I am not as bullish as others like ARK Invest, I think Tesla still has a bright future, especially due to their lead in making cheaper & cheaper great EVs. You can see how the vast majority of their sales has shifted to the model 3 & model Y, which are lower cost tiered vehicles, so, when you compare that with others like the new Hummer EV or the LucidAir, you start to get a grasp on why so many investors love Tesla & their potential to take over a big part of the EV market in the next decades.

EVs will also get additional help if the infrastructure bill that Biden has proposed, which [includes](https://imgur.com/scynXTS) $174B for electric vehicles passes, and with this being one of the biggest spending categories it’s likely even more money might be pushed towards clean energy solutions in all areas of the economy in the future.

**6.** **Economic Readings**

The consumer confidence [spiked](https://imgur.com/E1EpvnL) last month to almost 110, a level we haven’t seen in more than a year as. This is a great reading for companies that operate in the consumer discretionary sector and in real estate, as consumers are more likely to go out and spend money in those areas, though it still seems that people are somewhat scared of the rising oil prices & inflation possibilities.

The [ISM](https://imgur.com/V6Z8zDU) Service index also came in at the highest level since it’s inception, topping all 4 categories compared to the previous month, topping expectations by more than 5 points, which is insane, while the [composite](https://imgur.com/duUr0u6) PMI also showed the fasted growth in a long time.

**7.** **The Greed / Fear of The Market**

Like in previous posts, I wanted to point out again that you shouldn’t fall in the usual greed/buy [paradigm](https://imgur.com/Y9iHjVh). People are way to emotional when they think about money... and that leads to massive mistakes. People tend to see something go up and jump on board and say “I’m very pleased with my investment”. That’s exactly what we see during the optimism & euphoria stages, but when things start to shift people can’t really believe it until they finally reach the capitulation & discouragement stages, which leads usually to selling out of stocks at the bottom of the correction, dip or crash.

Well I think we’ve seen exactly that stages in the past weeks, as investors were feeling very discouraged from the recent drop in tech & small-cap stocks, with CNN’s Fear & Greed [Index](https://imgur.com/xCRPmBT) bottoming around 40 in the past weeks, which should have been the moment to go in and buy the dip, just like I did.

That’s why people also revert back to the old Buffet saying, be fearful when people are greedy and be greedy when people are fearful.

These were my top 7 recent developments I believe you need to know to better manage your portfolio. [Keep](https://imgur.com/RN30kuW) an eye on what the FED continues to say, how the jobless & unemployment numbers come in and how inflation continues to go. Even if the [economy](https://imgur.com/9aDtR3F) continues to gain jobs at a steady pace of 100k/month, it will still take until 2024 at the earliest to get to the labor force trend numbers we saw before 2020.

Expect some inflation scares to lead to a couple more corrections which could be great buying opportunities if you chose the right companies.

202,Quick DD on SunPower Corporation (SPWR)... highly shorted green energy company of interest,34,mmvxxc,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmvxxc/quick_dd_on_sunpower_corporation_spwr_highly/,23,"I've done a bit of research on the [upcoming rebalance for Black Rock's green energy funds](https://www.reddit.com/r/thecorporation/comments/mm5cdo/blackrockageddon_2_further_thoughts_and_work_on/). As seen in the link, 60-odd energy stocks are being added to the fund, at the expense of the existing larger stakes (looking at you, PLUG). 

.

While NEE is the little darling of the change, SunPower Corporation is on the short list of recommended adds. This is interesting, because SPWR is also on the *other* short list... [the list of highly shorted companies](https://www.highshortinterest.com/). SPWR at the time of this writing is over 22% short floated (GME is 24%), and I show -11% short float from the previous month. I'm surprised it's still this high, because the impending rebalance would buy a lot of shares, raising the price. Price goes up, shorts have to exit, things get squeezy. 

.

This is where I like to hope that some intern at one of these hedge funds is reading this post and going to get his boss. If WSB is aware of the potential squeeze, as well as the potential BlackRock buy, there are $600 million in shorts that need to make their way to the door ASAP. I'm not going to say this is Gamestop... we're not at $5... but the current suppressed price is $29.9, and the 3 week high is $35. Just removing the short pressure could get that back, even without the BlackRock buying. I like to hope just the potential of BlackRock's buy will take it that high, but WSB taking note might have a strong incentive effect on hedge fund rectal clenching and take it higher.

.

Fundamentally, SPWR is a semiconductor company, P/E ratio is 8.4 (well below semiconductor industry average 25.2), and profits are in a bit of a slump, which should pick up with the green push by the US Government. My interest is in the good price, the heavy short load, and the potential to squeeze. If Blackrock announces the stock in its ETFs, I expect a very nice rise.

.

tl;dr: SPWR is highly shorted and may join Blackrock ETFs. Hedge funds fear the ape. This makes for delicious banana.",1617929278.0

The energy grid as we know is going to change. Currently our grid works like we receive energy from a power plant in our region, and that power plant send energy to our individual homes through power lines

The future of the energy grid is through something called a virtual power plant. Were instead of one power plant fuelling every home in a region, we all distribute energy to each other with batteries.

So we all have batteries in our homes/commercial buildings and can distribute energy to each other, and even if you have your own solar roof, you can generate electricity and sell to your neighbourhood, etc

THIS IS HUGE, and it is happening QUICKER than you think

For those who don’t know, Elon musk is believer in this too, he stated multiple times that Tesla energy will be bigger than the automotive side. Same reason why he’s making a fuck ton of solar roofs/batteries. 

Why I think the push for wide scale of batteries/distributed energy grid is happening right now

Tesla has been quietly installing its own virtual power plants in various regions

 https://www.google.ca/amp/s/electrek.co/2021/04/06/tesla-powerwall-power-new-virtual-power-plant-new-york/amp/

This is his next big push, he completed the EV sector, now he is going for clean energy to charge the cars. I beg you guys to research tesla energy, there’s so much to say, and not enough space. A BIG disruption in the energy sector with everyone getting from batteries/solar/distributed energy is happening


Now what does Stem inc do? They MAKE the software for virtual power plants, so they add there software onto batteries to buy/sell energy to each other/ buy energy when cheap, distribute it to somewhere if their power is out, etc. They have the been collecting data on regions, markets for ever. In fact they even have the biggest network of energy systems connected, with a fuck ton of data. DATA/AI to run thousands of batteries all at once connecting to each other and moving energy around, it constantly learns and knows what to do in every situation, when to move energy at the right price, and where, etc.  There market cap is less than 3 billion. 

Once Elon musk pushes this, which I believe he will soon, Stem inc will rocket too, and even if Stem inc doesn’t become the top player in virtual power plant software, it is a trillion+ market (bigger than the ev market) 

Stem inc doubles their sales in 2020, and already 4xd their sales in 2021 (announced in January, from contracts)


PLEASE RESEARCH Tesla energy, virtual power plants. This is the next big disruption, and stem is a baby company that’s leading it",1618022707.0

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I might be the guy who used his emergency fund to take out puts on SPY, why would you blindly listen to me? Trading is a hobby for me and I hope to share a potentially great find with you all and teach some new skills along the way

This might not be the first time you have heard of Lordstown Motors ($RIDE). It seems people are finally starting to warm up to the company now that some positive news has come out, and I’m all for it. I’ve been chart watching this for a while and I’m glad people are finally starting to see through the veil of drama and realize being bullish on a prospective company is not some pipe dream, a feeling plenty of you should be familiar with. Because since when do we find Hindenburg Research, literally five dudes with a lot of money and a focus on “activist short selling”, coming in like your wife’s mean boyfriend on Christmas eve to tell you that Santa Clause isn’t real, to be a credible source?

But enough metaphors. Lordstown motors is an electric vehicle focused on developing the Endurance, an electric full-size pickup truck. If any of you are like me, you aren’t convinced by just one guy on the internet screaming “$STONK to the moon!”, you need to see proof that Lady Market is having another mood swing and changing her mind on the stock.

So that’s what I intend to do. I won’t give you the same boring old rundown of fundamentals that you get plenty of. If you want some of that [check out the post that was just made on the subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Instead, using technical analysis and a bunch of pretty crayon drawings, I will prove that not just I, but the market is changing its tone towards $RIDE. I’ve learned that the way to make significant money in this market is to find and bet on [oversold stocks like $RIDE](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lordstown-motors-becomes-oversold-ride-2021-04-05) that have all of the FUD priced in; live and die by the motto “buy the fear, sell the greed”. I believe $RIDE is the type of stock that traders will begin to buy hand over fist in the coming days and weeks, and hopefully I can teach some fresh blood a new skill along the way.

If you find yourself falling asleep at any point, just skip through and look at the pretty pictures like a Dr Seuss book.

**PART 2: Technical Analysis**

Now, as I already laid out, I believe that $RIDE is undervalued, however my style of trading rarely forms opinions based off of fundamentals alone. I prefer to trade on indicators. Many people have told me I read tea leaves, they call me John D Cuckefeller, and if you feel the same then read no further. But it's no coincidence that stocks tend to follow these indicators, and they are what led me to start liking the stock to begin with.

**Volume and Short Interest:**

Before we get into the technical analysis, I’d like to address this sub’s favorite market mechanic: short sales. According to the numbers given to us by [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/ride), short volume reached its recent peak directly after the short report, and has largely fallen and consolidated since then. Why are we seeing a consolidation period after a short attack? It is my belief that many of the shorts are beginning to take their profits and leave, realizing the stock has the potential for a huge rally. Not only are they scared of people like you, who will target a stock just to hurt short-sellers, but they also realize that we have found the floor for this stock and will begin an upswing off of this, and don’t want to stick around to be spammed with diamond emojis and prank pizza orders for Harambe to their moms house.

Even given all this, $RIDEs short volume is up 46 percent from last month, [to a total of 12.5 percent the total float](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/RIDE/short-interest/). And even more interesting to me is the fact that since the recent [reveal of the endurance betas](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/04/lmc-reveals-endurance-betas/) the short volume ratio has increased again to around 24 percent with no significant increase in volume. No significant changes in volume and an increase in short interest from an actual working product? Sounds like a few people had too much of a vested interest in Lordstown being “3-4 years away from production” like the bears claimed.

This is, in my opinion, *very significant* as it indicates the catalyst is probably not priced into the stock yet.

**Relative Strength**

For anyone who’s a fan of indicators, it should be obvious that $RIDE is massively oversold, to the point where demand can’t go anywhere but up. Just look at any relative strength oscillator; many traders use the RSI but I prefer to use the Stochastics. I won’t get too mathematical on you, but this chart essentially shows us the demand of a stock. Pretty simple. $RIDE has been in the 20th percentile oversold range for some time now, and is just starting to creep out now that demand is increasing for the stock. Rumors can’t last forever and the market is showing uncertainty in the current downward momentum. This should be seen as the first sign of renewed investor confidence in the company.

&#x200B;

[The relative strength of $RIDE, shown by Stochastics. More oversold just means more fuel for the explosion](https://preview.redd.it/jdeugezrvsr61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=a32d3b1fa3326fdff20c09b406c4780db04df869)

**MACD:**

This indicator line nicely plots out momentum behind current movements and can tell you when support in the opposite direction is beginning to form. Don’t overcomplicate this; when the purple line is above the orange line, the stock (often) goes up, and when it’s below the orange line it goes down. Traders use the crossovers of these two lines as an indicator of breakout events. In times of high volatility, violent swings in the MACD above and below the centerline can often result in violent reversals when they cross again. A great example can be seen with the MACD a couple weeks ago on a favorite around here; GameStop:

&#x200B;

[MACD analysis on GME. Anyone else remember the massive FUD during this time?](https://preview.redd.it/hl89sol1wsr61.jpg?width=1185&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=458e07447e4bc8462a3e6e982d2e67d493010e1d)

I noticed this crossover beginning to form, and that week when everyone was shitting on GME I bought more like any good retard would do. The MACD predicted the reversal perfectly by showing how downwards momentum was beginning to shift. The violent downswing below the centerline resulted in a violent upswing, and the rest should be obvious. A crossover event occurred and it rocketed from 40 to 150+ the very next day. I couldn't predict how much it would go up but one thing was clear: the MACD told us it was very unlikely to go down more, and in a time of great FUD, I bought more.

Now lets take a look at the MACD for $RIDE. Does the chart below give anyone else Déjà vu? Or did is it just me? Using what we've learned about the MACD and seeing the real-world example with GME, just take a look for yourself with $RIDE:

&#x200B;

[MACD analysis on $RIDE, looking absolutely bullish AF. A thing of beauty 🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/vsf3zynawsr61.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=0970eb9794859538a9eade2fe7ab539c10842080)

This was the first thing I noticed when I found this stock a couple weeks ago. Historically, the MACD has predicted massive uptrends before based on being very far below the center. Similarly, we recently had another event that spread mass doubt on $RIDE and pushed the MACD far below the center line in a violent manner (I wonder what it was).

Despite the price continuing to decrease the past 2 weeks, the MACD line has flattened out and finally crossed the signal line in orange. This is a good sign that negative pressure is decreasing and one thing is for sure, the stock is not likely to go much lower in the short term. With the recent dip in the moving average being so far below the centerline, $RIDE is honestly primed for ignition and I've been buying. When you see a MACD like this, I don’t really have many reasons not to buy and follow the trend except maybe if the Great Depression Part 2 is starting.

**Price Action:**

PRICE ACTION!!!

The most important indicator of all. It's easy to get caught up in all the pretty colors and forget about the bigger picture of price action. A change in things like volume and overall trend means more than any indicator, which should be used to contextualize the price action and not the other way around. For the sake of simplicity, I won’t go too far into this one. Individual candlesticks are valuable, but in the bigger picture we can see that the current price seems to be at a historical floor at the moment, and more importantly, the price action and volume is trading in a narrow range of consolidation for the past week or so. Specifically, a breakout above 14 dollars or below 10 could easily spark a much greater movement of volume and price. We don’t need to force anything or look at fancy charts to figure this out, but instead just look at the actions of real market participants.

Combining the price action with the other indicators to give context is where things get really juicy and we can find some unexpected things.

[Positive divergence of the MACD and price action. Momentum is increasing against a bearish price trend, and price is now consolidating before liftoff](https://preview.redd.it/0k28fdixwsr61.png?width=1622&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ed734f7bac97d0982b7f0791bf4e6df33c3b017)

Instead of the smooth 1-day period chart, we’re looking at a 4-hour period for more details. Notice how the price action has been in a trend down but the MACD has been in a trend up? This is called positive divergence, and is a result of a stocks momentum not agreeing with its current trending direction, which is a pretty big deal. Many traders use divergence in addition to the other indicators to assess the likelihood of a reversal, and based on the other factors and presence of a catalyst, I believe a reversal is being foreshadowed right in front of us. As of just yesterday, April 6th, the divergence resulted in the MACD crossing above the centerline, indicating that the price action has started seeking an uptrend. This is significant reason to believe that a breakout above resistance is much more likely than a crash, a huge amount of upward pressure is building. The price is currently consolidating in an area of low volatility, and though I don’t want to get too far into the Bollinger Band indicator, this could result in a “[Bollinger Band Squeeze](https://www.tradingsetupsreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/BollingerandKeltnerSqueezeExample.jpg)” upwards very soon.

These are the indicators I use for any stock I look at, and for $RIDE specifically, the technical upside far outweighs the downside for me. There is just too much potential for an explosion right now upwards of $30-$35, and not enough potential for a further crash, to justify ignoring this.

**PART 3: Catalysts and Fundamentals**

Since indicators are driven by price action, which is itself driven by catalysts, they usually won’t run far without some sort of news to cling on to. As far as catalysts go, Lordstown did just release their [beta trucks](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/celebrating-the-first-lordstown-endurance-betas) last week. News which, I cannot stress enough, *I DO NOT THINK THIS CATALYST IS PRICED IN YET* as discussed earlier. They are also [showcasing their truck in one of the most brutal proving grounds imaginable at the SCORE San Felipe 250 off-road race](https://www.autoweek.com/racing/more-racing/a35598958/lordstown-endurance-ev-pickups-baja-debut-is-serious-business/) in Mexico's Baja California Peninsula on April 17 (less than 10 days away). Not to mention their market cap when compared to their worse-off competitors. The current price just doesn’t make sense.

I also I like the design of the truck itself; image is everything, especially when compared to some of its competitors (I’m sorry Canoo bulls but wtf is that thing? Not to mention the Cybertruck). Lordstown is targeting commercial fleets and government contracts initially. Yesterday, the Camping World CEO tweeted a [leak to an RV that Lordstown is working on](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) (the Lordstown logo is in the center of the wheel) through [their partnership](https://investor.campingworld.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry-e59212362/default.aspx). The electric RV market could be huge. The catalysts are plenty but the market is still timid, for now.

**PART 4: Conclusion**

Well, I hope you learned a few things from this post, even if I end up being wrong about everything I laid out here. As I stated, this is not my full-time job; I do this as a hobby. Feel free to ask me any questions regarding this info; I know some of the technical analysis can be confusing. Knowledge is power among the knowledge impaired.

And for $RIDE specifically, the technical upside far outweighs the downside for me. It has all the same signals that make me love other big names around here, and there is just too much potential for an explosion right now and not enough potential for a further crash, to justify ignoring this. Lest we all forget [Morgan Stanley’s 10$ price target on Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/morgan-stanley-tesla-shares-could-drop-to-10-in-worst-case-scenario.html), have a good $RIDE everyone, and don’t let the short bugs bite.

**Positions:** 65 shares at 12.94, 2x $20 07/16C, 1x 15$ 01/21/22c

**EDIT:** Forgot to add, but per page 21 of [this slide deck](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/static-files/ef77bce6-b19a-4288-a651-e08089f1362f), the current replacement value of Lordstown’s 6.2 million square foot factory is over $3 billion, but the current market cap of $RIDE is only $2.01 billion. An EV stock that is trading almost 50% below its asset value? Come on now. Everything I’m seeing is screaming buy.

**TLDR;**

I love $RIDE’s pretty charts, and there is way too much technical upside here to ignore. IMO, $RIDE is poised for a breakout, and this is the type of chart that technical traders will begin noticing and placing big bets on. $RIDE to the moon 🚀🚀🚀",1617853234.0

219,Greatest option arbitrage ever... quick 100% reuturn with no move in the underlying...on the most boomer-ish stock there is: Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)... with chart to back it up.,0,mnmbva,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mnmbva/greatest_option_arbitrage_ever_quick_100_reuturn/,43,"This picture represents an incredible arbitrage opportunity to capitalize on the sleeping market maker who is pricing the Berkshire January '22 $300 call option for $4.80.

As you can see below, these contracts were $8 three weeks ago at the same stock price of \~$265. I think there is an opportunity here to make an immediate 100% return without any change in Berkshire's stock price.

What is unique here is that vega on this call option is 0.7. I've been following this contract for the past 8 months and IV has gone up as high as 22%, compared to 16% today. If IV gets back to 20%, these contracts go up by (20-16) = 4 x 0.7 = $2.80 immediatly.

Icing on the cake here is that Berkshire trades for 1.27x book value compared to \~1.5x historical average. Re-rating back to the mean would get us a \~$315 stock. Berkshire is also the poster child for the ""reopening trade"" as all if its subsidiaries are cyclical in nature and exposed to the overall market recovery.

I think these contracts - the Jan '22 $300 calls - can go from $4.80 to $20+ with a little patience.",1618018245.0

222,My non-technical SPY options scalping strategy,66,mmkby4,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmkby4/my_nontechnical_spy_options_scalping_strategy/,29,"1. I try to keep my trading only to 10am EDT to 11am (I’ve found that if I stay in much longer trades have a greater likelihood of turning against me).

2. I watch price action before I jump in to see where prices are bouncing around and identify a channel I can hop in to. I’ll check the chart but for some reason my brain processes the actual numerals better so I like to keep an eye on SPY % changes and share price change. For example, if it is bouncing between 0.02% and 0.06%.

3. One a price channel is identified, depending on timing, I’ll buy an in the money call or put for the closest expiry date. Based on my example, I would buy the call at 0.02% or the put at 0.06%. I’ve nearly lost my ass on 0 DTEs so I prefer to have at least a day to recover if the trade moves against me, but holding overnight is really less than ideal for so many different reasons, theta decay being #1.

3. I buy to open in multiples of 10 contracts and depending on price action I’m looking to capture a .05 or .10 movement in my favor. Sometimes this happens within 10 seconds and sometimes it is a few minutes. I only trade one lot at a time and once I buy to open I will immediately input a limit sell because the price action can be so fast you cannot rely on reaction time alone to capture profits. Also, if I miss my entry because things are moving quickly, I will wait for entry or take the other side of the price channel, or wait to identify a new channel.

4. Manage risk appropriately. Size trades appropriate to preferred risk levels. If the price action gets away from the target, sometimes patience can see through to a profit; it’s a personal decision to know when it’s time to take an L and close out. Don’t be greedy or you’ll get burned. 

This is not financial advice and this strategy can be stressful and requires full attention and fast decision making. Just my wack ass way of trading options, there is probably a better way 🤪",1617886304.0

# What are ""Day Trades"" and how are they counted?

Tip: Read from the bottom up if you want the juiciest examples first

A day trade is buying and selling the same security on the same day in a margin account. Day trades are counted based on the opening transaction and whether that opening transaction was closed out on the same day. Partial fills are not counted as multiple trades on the opening or closing side. However, if part of your order fills, and then you modify it and the rest fills, that may be counted as two day trades.

Examples of day trading:

* On Tuesday, 100 shares of XYZ stock are purchased. Later on that same day, 100 shares of XYZ stock are sold. This is considered to be a day trade.


* On Monday, 10 shares of XYZ stock are purchased. Later on that same day, 5 shares of XYZ stock are sold. This is considered to be a day trade.


* On Thursday, 50 shares of XYZ stock are purchased. On Friday, another 50 shares of XYZ stock are purchased. Later on that Friday, 50 shares of XYZ stock are sold. This is considered to be one day trade.


* On Wednesday, 100 shares of XYZ are purchased. Later that same day, you sell 50 shares of XYZ and before the market close you sell another 50 shares of XYZ. This is one day trade. In this case, even though you sold your 100 shares of XYZ in two separate transactions, it still counts as one day trade because one single opening transaction was closed out.


* On Monday, 50 shares of XYZ are purchased. Later that day, another 50 shares of XYZ are purchased. Before the market close on Monday, 100 shares of XYZ are sold. This is two day trades. Here, we have two opening transactions closed by a single sell order. The first group of 50 shares of XYZ was bought and sold on the same day, and a second group of 50 shares was also bought and sold on the same day.


* On Friday, you put in 2 buy orders of 50 shares of XYZ. You then sell 51 shares of XYZ later that day. This is also two day trades. All 50 shares from the first opening transaction were bought and sold on the same day. One share from the second opening transaction was bought and sold on the same day. Even though only one share from Order 2 was sold, the purchase and sale of that single share in a single trading day counts as a day trade.


* On Wednesday, 3 orders are made: Buy 2 shares of XYZ, Buy 5 shares of XYZ, and Buy 50 shares of XYZ. Later that same day, an order to Sell 50 shares of XYZ is made. This is three day trades. We pair the closing transaction with the opening orders during that trading day, beginning with the earliest time of execution. This means you closed out all of opening Order 1, all of opening Order 2 and part of opening Order 3, resulting in **three day trades.**",1617853058.0
233,BABA $350 share - Charlie Munger just bought shares!,88,mmgk4q,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmgk4q/baba_350_share_charlie_munger_just_bought_shares/,44,"It caught my eye that Charlie Munger (long-time partner to Warren Buffet) just bought BABA. Buffet and Munger had avoided technology for most of their careers before they hit a home run with AAPL. Its unusual to see these old guys buying into tech stocks, so I dug in and did a quick sum-of-the-parts analysis. Here is what I came up with, would love to get any feedback in case I am missing something.

* Core China eCommerce biz has 60% of all eCommerce in China. This is a highly profitable cash cow - approx. $250/share using a 25x P/E.
* Other China retail including leading grocery co Hema and stake in HK-listed Alibaba Health – approx. $20/sh
* Net Cash - approx. $20/share
* Stake in Ant Financial at ½ the valuation prior to canceled IPO  - approx. $20/share
* AliCloud – leading cloud company akin to the AWS of China - approx. $20/share
* All others – Eleme (Meituan competitor), Lazada (leading SE Asia eComm co), Cainiao logistics, Alibaba.com wholesale biz, Yoku online video, etc. - $20+/share
* Add all this up and total value/share is approx. $350/sh.
* Stock closed at $225, so \~65% of sum-of-the-parts, or in other words, we have 55% upside.

Alibaba appears to have a collection of growing/compounding businesses, so not only do you get short-term appreciation to sum-of-the-parts, but also good growth of the sum-of-the-parts. This can easily become a 200-300% return in \~2 years or less.",1617872769.0
234,Why PSFE is a GREATLY undervalued and overlooked stock. 3X candidate according to analyst Steve Grasso.,267,mm8437,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mm8437/why_psfe_is_a_greatly_undervalued_and_overlooked/,116,"**Introduction to Paysafe (PSFE):**

Paysafe Limited is a digital commerce company. Paysafe has its users in more than 120 countries across the United States, Canada and Europe to conduct commerce across online, mobile, in-application and in-store channels. The Company is focuses on iGaming, including online betting related to sports, esports, fantasy sports, poker and other casino games and Emerging Markets, which includes stock, FX and trading, direct marketing, which can include nutraceuticals and multi-level marketing, travel and entertainment, integrated payments and digital goods.

&#x200B;

**Quick and easy:**

Paysafe is a fin-tech company that just got out of a SPAC-merger, which immediately reeks given the recent SPAC-hype but HEAR ME OUT.

&#x200B;

**Why did they go public via SPAC?**

These days a lot of companies go public via SPACs. In PSFE’s case, already a big established company, this has allowed them to go a little under the radar. The only reason they went public via SPAC is because of a $9B agreement with Bill Foley to go public through Trasimene Acquisition Corp. II (BFT). This saved them from the bureaucratic process of going public through an IPO.

&#x200B;

**If they’d do an IPO, they would be a lot more covered by mainstream media and a conservative average for their IPO would probably be closer to $48.45.**

&#x200B;

**Here are EV/Revenue ratios of comparable companies, and PSFE equivalent at current levels:**

⁃ PayPal : 12.8x - 16x (based on PT) >>> PSFE: $26.67 - $33.33

⁃ Repay : 13.75x -> PSFE: $28.65

⁃ Affirm: 32.2x -> PSFE: $67.08

⁃ Nuvei : 40x -> PSFE: $83.33

⁃ Adyen : 18.6x -> PSFE: $38.75

⁃ Square : 11.2x -> PSFE: $23.33

⁃ Shift 4 : 11x -> PSFE: $22.91

⁃ [Bill.com](https://bill.com/) : 84x -> PSFE: $175

⁃ Stripe : 52.8x -> PSFE: $110

⁃ Chime : 50x -> PSFE: $104

⁃ Checkout : 150x -> PSFE: $312

Average (excluding outlier Checkout): $75.54

Conservative Average (excluding all above $100): $48.45

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, most of these companies have negative earnings and smaller margins than Paysafe.

Also, PayPal and SQ doesn’t have the risk assessment that Paysafe has got. Paysafe is one of the biggest payment providers in EU with their Paysafecards and online payment solutions, it is essentially an anonymous payment solution that anyone can use. This is BIG, especially in gambling. But also for kids that just want to go to the shop, buy a Paysafecard and redeem it for Fortnite skins. Paysafe has got a moat.

Paysafe is one of the most prominent payment providers in the booming iGaming industry. I can’t see how this is not a no-brainer at this price.

237,The Market is Near Fucked at This Point,163,mmb96x,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmb96x/the_market_is_near_fucked_at_this_point/,304,"There are a few outliers that have particularly showed up today that causes me some concern.

1.	⁠We had a slew of great data on the economic front. Record high job momentum. Possibly new spending on infrastructure. A populous looking to spend money. All of this is a positive but the market tanked over the last two days. The 10-year yields haven’t moved either which is definitely worrying. You should be very worried that they haven’t moved. What this is saying is that in lieu of rates not moving, the market has already priced in the economic boom. So there isn’t much upside left.
2.	⁠Main Street boom will happen without a hitch. The market went up last year because it factored that in. If you remember 2020, people lost jobs and government fiscal and monetary policy alleviated what COULD have happened in 2021, 2022, and 2023. It was not for only 2020.
3.	⁠QE was start tightening much more rapidly than you expect. A stronger stranglehold over the Fed’s purse means the cost of borrowing goes up and business expansion slows down, leading to shrinking margins for high growth stocks that have already been projected. This means that companies will not hit their estimate earnings and reduce their stock price.

The market is frothy. You all had a good ride, but there is more downward pressure on stock performance at this point. The economy will boom. We will see a mouthwatering GDP growth. But consider that the stock market is overweight on high growth tech and other bubbles. When it sells, it’ll ruin the whole bunch. This impending collapse will only correct stocks while Main Street will have their time in the Sum.

Edit: CORRECTION- The market did not tank over the last two days. However, intraday trading is hovering around ATH for the past two days with a booming economy looming on the horizon. If it hasn’t moved up since then, it’s deciding where to go. Usually ATH either go up steadily with lots of volatility or it crashes.",1617856279.0
