The twitter account is retarded even by this subs standardsYeah, cringe af and not needed. Any reason for its existence might be just linking good DD's but if someone wanted a DD from a retard they'd come here anyway.The Twitter is a sad attempt at monetization. Get it the fuck out. There are no leaders here, only those who prevent impending doom.

wsbmod speeds up the impending doom.Mods, please do not make this sub cringey though a cringey twitter accountWhile I enjoy the DD's, diamond handing and the loss porn. I don't enjoy people thinking wsb controls the market or whatever. This is just a forum where people post retarded shit and sometimes genius shit like the short squeeze thesis. There is no "collective". It's just that the DD was so good that people joined in. There are still people paper handing and people that think GME is too risky whereas others are diamond handing and think of GME as a long term play than a short squeeze. All these statements like "we need to be taken seriously now" or "we control the market", "new money > old money" paints wsb in a negative light and it's just not true at all. People told DFV to sell all along the way to what he has now and he had a choice. Just because someone tells you to sell or buy you don't have to follow through. Everyone here is free to do their own analysis and make their own decisions.Long time lurker, I like the sub it makes me laugh and get through my boring day job. The Twitter is a waste. It makes no sense to respond to MM they will just twist it to their advantage.

My vote: eliminate it

Nuke it from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.The fuck? Take that shit down rn. Literally the last thing we need.
I only tell someone I know about WSB when I suspect that they are as retarded as me.Lawyer here - perception is reality. By creating an identity via Twitter etc that distills all of our retarded opinions into a single voice, that creates a perception of a single entity. Regardless of the truth. I think Cramer is hoodwinking us through shoutouts etc into forming this identity so the big players have an opportunity to put this subreddit six feet under.Twitter account needs to goJust report the profile as a profile pretending to be someone else

Edit; I did not know the Twitter account was actually created by an official mod. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0xphu/announcement_official_moderator_twitter_account/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfThe Twitter is definitely power tripping mod cringe. Holy shit youre a moderator on a subreddit not the leader of a revolutionAgreed. Brings too much attention to a sub that is already becoming normie-like at an alarming rateClose the twitter acctAgreed. This is just a forum everyone expressing their thoughts, happiness and sadness. No reason to pretend we are a group acting together.I agree. Theres shouldn't be a single voice to represent our autismShut it downbunch of power hungry fucks. the moment you get s lil bit of fame and youre all dying to represent a collective like some sort of cheeto president. take that shit down

edit: wsb is not a collective entity. WSB is a page full of retards and other non retards that posts our understanding the market. we dont force people to buy or sell. we make fun of people that buy or sell because they have stupid losses. that wsbmod twitter account is a fraud account as much as citron is with their DDsI'm a very new member here, but it's pretty apparent that whomever owns the administrative control of this subreddit is foremost concerned with marketing and monetizing the sub.  Lame, commercialized, trite, and so on.u/zjz shut it down/u/zjz what's your take on the twitter accountSigned.Mos Eisley doesn’t have a radio station.That twitter does nothing good. Keep autism to platforms better suited for it."Dear SEC many of us claim that we're just a bunch of autists acting independently but no, look, honestly, we are working together to manipulate the market, and here I am telling you all about it! Me! The leader! Of the organisation! Showing off on twitter! "


It's a very bad idea and if it doesn't get the sub shut down first, it might eventually get some folks arrested for securities fraud.Seconded. Shut down the account and get rid of the mod that thought it up.Twitter is a bad idea... its retarded, it will fall on its back, humiliate the mods who tried to set up a voice for 1.9 million people, and the sub will carry on.Agreed. Please take down the wsbmod account. At the end of the day it only hurts the community. We’re not some Anonymous hackers or a cult. Cramer has been trying to paint us in that light since last week.

We’re here to make money, not attract the wrong kind of attention.The Twitter is cringe as fuckThe notion that this online forum can control the market is insane.... If anyone says hey you guys are manipulating the market, go ahead and point them to the price run-ups and subsequent drops that occur every morning like clock work. Literally every morning the price runs up and then drops almost to the same magnitude and during that time frame there is probably a volume of 3-5 million shares?

So anyone claiming market manipulation by WSB is insane. Do they think this forum is executing a coordinated attack that produces 120 - 200 million dollars worth of market transactions every single fucking day for the last 3 days?!?!?! ? I mean seriosuly, like clock work every morning there is a massive run up with a following dump in shares with massive volume. 

Jim Cramer knows better. We cant manipulate GME. There is too much moeny running around. Buying and holding stocks becasue we think there is a short squeeze or long term growth opportunity is not illegal.  Honestly I think he like everyone else thinks its entertaining to see the little guy stick it to the man.92%  YES 

That's a DELETE ACCOUNT 

Mods pls listen to us and delet acountCringy. Reminds me of that Pepe the Frog bullshit.It’s always the mods that bring a sub down. RIPPersonally, I don't really give a shit one way or another about the Twitter, so don't take this as me before for or against it.

I'm not a lawyer, but I'm starting to wonder if the mods are opening themselves up to a bit of liability with this Twitter account. I'm pretty sure there are certain rules around disclosing positions and conflicts of interest you have to follow if you're recommending stocks to avoid legal problems. When the mods are just posting on Reddit, they're just another voice in the crowd of autists on here and they can fall back on the idea that they really are just here to remove posts and what they post is their individual personal opinions. By creating the Twitter account, they've now starting to look like the "leaders of WSB" and are actively trying to shape the opinions of the sub reddit to manipulate the market.

I'm not saying that's what they are trying to do, but just how it looks from the outside. By creating the mod Twitter it gives the impression that this decentralized message board now has a leader or small group of leaders.

Again, I'm not a lawyer, so maybe I'm completely off base, but this just popped into my head when I first saw the post about the Twitter.

Also, please don't message me with comments about how Cramer, the banks, market makers, etc engage in price manipulation all the time and the big boys are just mad that "we're getting one over on them" . I genuinely don't care. That's not my point. My post isn't about what is fair and what isn't. All I'm wondering about is whether the Twitter account could cause problems since there's now the illusion of leadership behind the actions of this sub.Add me to the twitter does more harm than good camp.

This place works best as a hivemind.  It doesn't need a voice to speak for it.

If that Twitter account fucks up and posts something the collective decides they don't like, it'll be an unholy shitstorm of epic proportions.

Nix the TwitJust read some of the tweets. Embarrassing. 

" Our culture is now the culture of the entire finance industry. Our memes are now viral across every social platform. Our shitty DD now moves entire markets. "

My god. Delusions of grandeur much? 

Please stop.AgreedAye. Shut it down.although I get the rationale for why the wsb twitter account was created, I really feel like there will be unintended consequences that we may not like later on. I support shutting it down.I go on Twitter myself and try to push our memes and show my gains/losses but I will never namedrop wsb out of fear of getting us shut down.yeah let's just stick to reddit. that account doesn't represent ALL of usMods should not be trying to represent us anywhere outside of reddit. That twitter account is NOT the voice of WSB.

edit: I was banned for this comment?Absolutely agreeThis twitter account is exactly the kind of thing we don’t want. This form is no different to any other Internet forum, we are not some organised machine that is going against hedgefunds, it just so happens that DD on GME is solid and a a lot of people are shouting it at the same time.I hate thisMods wanted more exposure/power and this shit is already causing more headache for rest of us. 


Lmao bruh

Edit. What's mods' actual intentions or goals for creating a twitter account anyway?Yeah honestly after reading these posts today I sub to this view as well. I feel like the beauty of WSB is that it’s a public forum, there’s no 1 guy manipulating the market here. Also, why give people a concrete reason to hate this sub?100% 

will upvote daily posts like thisIt would just raise further suspicion and supply the bears more ammo if it were to be shut down right now. Easing off of it would be a better move imoSignedI don't think WSB is a problem, it may actually help to unfold obscure shit thrown against this sub.

But I have to agree. What a shitty post, if you intend to post ignorant defamatory shit instead of prove them the otherwise you may just bury deep this Twitter account and everybody pretends that never happened.this is some u/WSB_GOD shitIf GME was trading somewhere that authorities were more eager to intervene trading would have been halted weeks ago. Hell, even for US standards... Trading halts happen all the time. For a big stock to have trading halted now it'd take something crazy, but maybe 10 years ago if a person was going live on TV calling for an online forum to pump his stocks, there at the very least would have been some investigations started on the spot. 

tl;dr: tell to this mod to quit acting like a kid. It could ruin everything.cringe ass twitter

get off the fucking platform and delete the account modsAgreed.[https://twitter.com/wsbmod/status/1352346820396118022](https://twitter.com/wsbmod/status/1352346820396118022)

&#x200B;

Like why? Who asked them to post this, they just want fame and clout, fuck the mods.Someone proposed to just make the account tweet highly upvoted posts, this would be perfect imo, social media presence but no one actually controls it.Shut it down.what is the point of a wsb twitter? i dont get the point but im retardedAgreed, it was fun in the beginning but now it just got too weird.

Made a quick strawpoll just to keep track how many ppl want it shut down.

[Poll to shut down twitter account.](https://strawpoll.com/jyrdyd371)

OP you should make one and throw it on the post.It's wackWSB took off and now the mods or mod just wants to bask in all the glory I guess. It’s cringe.Shut it down. Don't create a single voice for WSB, or imply in any way that there is a leader.

Stay rowdy, stay chaotic. Think less cohesive unit, more swarm. There is no need to be coherent or to make sense in any way.

Lots of people can't cope with things that don't make sense. People like Shitron and Melvin, when they front up to their subscribers, or their investors, or their board of trustees, have to make sense, and the people on whose favor they depend can't cope with things that don't make sense. Fuck. them. all.

WSB is unique because it doesn't make sense. It makes no sense to YOLO your savings into calls on a single stock. It makes no sense to pursue tendies based on totally degenerate logic generated by a swarm of autists on their computers.

Except most of you fucks are on your phones because your wife's boyfriend doesn't let you use the computer very often.I’m a new retard so who cares what I think but I agreeThe tweet sounds like a villian origin story wtfI say if we keep it it should only retweet our hilarious memes and videos made by the community. And only address situations if really needed.Clean up the reports that come in and shut the fuck up. This cringy Twitter shit makes us all look like 19 year olds who think we're witty as fuck. The tweet at Cramer 'We needa talk, hit us up on blckberry' is just so unfunny & they were really trying fucking hard. Makes us all look like complete losersFuck the TwitterShut it down this is so bad and not who we areSigned, wsb is fine as it is.\>teenage wattpad fanfiction

couldn't have put it better. 

wsb ego is getting a bit too big rn, if we keep it down a bit we can keep enjoying the tendies without attracting negative attention.Literally everyone thinks it's a bad idea. Just take it down.Get rid of it before WSB incriminates themselvesI got temporarily banned for asking about this :( I like the mods just dont see the need for a twitterBetter to leave WSB in it's own little wing of the internet IMO. Too many dumbasses making moves based off WSB means things get unpredictable.https://twitter.com/wsbmod/status/1352298871192494082?s=20

Dude...what the actual FUCK???

Somebody please reign in this megaphone weilding retard before the SEC thinks this was coordinated or something ffs... 

I love this sub - fuck having it close because some fucking virgin with a micropenis is vocally daydreaming while "representing" us. 

This man needs to be offered to the SEC as a sacrifice.I agreeI second. I don’t even have a Twitter in the first placeMods are even further on the fucking spectrum jfcLol the lead mod gave up trying, and the twitter user wont remove it, so the subreddit will be quarantined, and eventually banned. Shame, but thats how good things come and go. Honestly can't be surprised with how many new mods theyve added in recent times.I still have ptsd from last time someone got power hungry. Please remove.Really hate saying I agree because I like the concept, not the execution.  

The fucking WSB Twitter feed is showing up on my work Twitter account.  That is how broad it has become which means any edge this gang of degenerates had is **GONE**.   The whole point of this is to do things without anyone knowing WTF is going on minus the WSB gang.When geese shit on your lawn is it a coordinated effort? Or is it just a bunch of identical animals all doing the same thing independently. That's what this sub is, a flock of geese shitting on some old guys lawn occasionally flying in formationRemoved lolremoved, lmao wowI’m fine with the Twitter account, if it’s used as a means to share the top rated DD of the day / shitpost/ meme with the occasional clap back at some naysayer or verb (@TimCook eat my dongus you fuckin nerd)


I don’t think the Twitter account should push a particular stock or movement. It’s not the voice of the sub. The Twitter account should share the best and brightest autistic contributions of this sub to the worldnot shut it down but WSB mod account should NOT be speaking on behalf of retards in WSB.

it should be strictly tweeting stuff like a popular post, or when the rule changes, and etc...What the fuck is the point of the Twitter account besides to simultaneously make jack asses out of all of us and put a target on our back
